The previous chapters have been the result of years of study. I wrote these
chapters around 2005 and am now editing them. In the explaination of the
classifications and function microvita I have tried to be as rational and
objective as possible with these very subjective experiences. I tried to keep
these ideas based on my own experience as much as possible without
extrapolating ideas. This is a fundamental duty for the spiritual investigator
of tantric and microvita science. One should try to be as objective as
possible while removing personal prejudices or ideological biases that skew
interpretations of these subtle perceptions. Aurobindu saw yoga as
“mystical empiricism.” I like the spirit empirical science, of having cross-
references and peer review and think that yogis who try to teach
metaphysics to others should be as scientfically minded as possible,
scrutinize their own experiences, and review them with other investigators.
It is a rigorous, self-critical position that I have tried to maintain throughout
the work. Now for the fun improvisation.
The following stories are collections of personal experiences or experiences
of people close to me. There are no literary exaggerations. Only a few small
details have been changed in a few stories regarding the people involved. I
did not want to reveal the deep experiences of others in my book. Instead, I
attributed just a few of these real experiences of people very close to me to
myself, the narrator in these stories. Now it is time to apply theory. I hope
you can discern between some various classes of positive mentities like the
Siddhas, Vidyadharas, Yaksas, etc., as well as understand the influence of
some negative mentities.


<strong>A Few Stories of Quetzal Manik (Pluma Blanca)</strong>

Pluma Blanca always had a very elevated vibration. When people came
near him they would begin to sway in a counter-clockwise direction.
Sometimes their heads would begin to tilt and subtly twirl in an almost
imperceptible circular motion. He explained that whether you are speaking
of the Cosmic Nucleus of Hunab Ku or the Conscious Nucleus of the Atman
radiating behind our minds, the movement around either a physical or
spiritual nucleus is always a play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces.
They have the same dynamics on all planes of being. There are physical
vortexes of motion in the physical world where there is the weight and
gravity of matter and also vortexes of subtle, mental energy that act and
interact with thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. To harmonize the
macrocosm with the microcosm, the universe with the individual, one must
find this secret flow of Tao both within the mind and in one’s world, planet,
and its plants and animals. On the outside Pluma Blanca’s ancestors
studied the movement of the planets and the natural cycles. This practice
was never disconnected to the internal practice of meditation. Meditation is
the science of seeing behind all of the vortexes and movements of the
human mind. A mind that is pure sees into and understands the movements
around Hunab Ku, the Cosmic Nucleus that is within us all. Every human
being that has truly searched has seen into this great treasure deep within
a balanced human existence. We understand that there is always
something pure, eternally renewed when we live in harmony with creation.
This inspiration has never abandoned us, only we have forgotten It.

<strong>A Not So Fleeting Romance</strong>

Pluma Blanca (White Feather), or Quetzal Manik (in maya), came by the clinic for a surprise visit a few years ago. It was my first time to see him. He seemed to know all about me but didn’t say very much. He hardly even spoke Spanish. He liked to talk to me about Tantra and share ideas of the Tantra of the Mayas, the lineage of meditation and healing that he learned from his fore-fathers. Although a healer of all types of diseases, he was fundamentally a mystic who loved to meditate in the forest. He was my wife’s teacher, an indigenous Maya from Campeche. When my wife was attending a European patient he went to the clinic and entered the treatment room directly. He grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper and then wrote down a list of names on the paper. The names were the first and last names of the lovers the young woman had in the last year. The list was a little too long.

He would speak in Maya but nobody understood him. He then began to write to her in Spanish while somebody else translated to her in English. He explained that when humans have sexual intercourse their minds remain energetically connected for 7 years. There is a subtle transmission and continued connection of mental energy shared between the 2 entities. This may be something very pure and harmonious or it may be painful or even degrading, depending on the nature of the relationship. Like two photons sent in different trajectories in a quantum physics experiment, they two lovers continue to communicate and mimic each-others movements across time and space, just like the two photons.  Even though they may never see, nor even think of each-other again, and perhaps are escaping eachother at "light speed", there still remain subtle mental impressions that “reside” within each-other and continue to "entangle."

Another complicating factor is the mental confusion that one carries if one changes or has frequent partners. The imbalanced, frustrated, and distorted energies of others sympathetically vibrate with the minds of the other person, and vice-versa. It sounded as if he was speaking of the transmission of a mental virus in much the same way as a physical virus, but with the mind and its clusters of memories and emotions as the vehicle of transmission directly into another mind. Instead of being infected physically, one remains “infected” by another’s mind for 7 years. A part of that person’s soul, or subtle mind is carried inside and continues to live inside of another, for better or for worse. The negative energetic effects of the adventures (frustrations, manipulations, conflicts, turmoil, depression, etc.) of one partner begin to harm his/her mind that sympathetically vibrates with the ex-lover.  Their minds were once very intimate.  They enjoyed the relationship and presently the ego wants to forget that experience and move on to others.  "Love is what happens to two people who don't know eachother."  Although they are not connected and don't even care for each other any longer, they still penetrate eachother's minds at the subtle psychic and energetic levels.  Perhaps there is some repulsion and/or attraction, some resentment or frustrated longing that keeps their minds in resonance. When is "free love" ever free?  Somebody always ends up getting hurt and the result is almost always harm and not love.  They try to forget but a part of them still resonates with the other. The shared residual impressions still reside within one and continue to recreate the same dramas as all other earlier relationships.  Although this partner may live a responsible and pure life after this relation, there may still be some degree of resonance with the ex-partner and his/her continued, unbridled degradation.  Of course, the degree of this subtle resonance is stronger in proportion to the weakness of one's resolve to remain integrated and whole.  Hopefully, the suffering and conflict and emotional abandonment awakens one to greater responsibilities and precaution in romantic relationships.  A strong mind may more easily overcome this resonance although it still persists and harms.  A weak and indulgent mind, on the contrary, may fall even deeper into distortions with the ex-partner who also continues to fall into dissipation.  However, it is not just these two individuals that are in resonance but all of their partners as well.  Therefore, the possible negative effects are multiplied by all the multiplied relationships of all inter-connected partners.

I am not quite sure why he said "7 years", why 7 instead of 10 or 5, for example?  However, I do like the imagery of seven, like "7 years of bad luck" for breaking a mirror.  Similairly, in true love between two sentient beings both beings reflect eachother like mirrors.  If one party is unfaithful, then it is like breaking a mirror in which the faith, confidence and inspiration created from the reflection of true and chaste love in the other is shattered to pieces.  The pieces are but fragments of love from many insecure minds, distorted and mixed into a collage of confusion. The soul becomes an over-crowded house instead of a silent temple.  

He explained quite compassionately that her emotional instability was only worsened by her romantic adventures and were gradually making her physically ill. She was an attractive young woman with very liberal values who simply didn’t understand these ideas before he explained it to her. She, like so many others made an all too common error of confusing love with sex, was not satisfied and so began to exploit that part of her being in an effort to compensate for her dissatisfaction.  It was the beginning of an addiction and Pluma Blanca explained it to her very clearly and calmly.  She didn’t feel threatened nor judged, and seriously pondered his diagnosis. I believe that her conscience understood what Pluma Blanca was communicating. She knew she was suffering and wasn’t happy and somebody had just probed into her private life to offer her some clues as to how to understand her confusions. Before the treatment she was terrorizing all of the young spiritually-disciplined boys around here with her tiny, mini skirts. In the days after that consultation she put on a more modest skirt.


<strong>Om in C</strong>

Although Pluma Blanca was born 114 years on this planet earlier than when
I met him, he was a perfect child who always liked to share his toys with
me. This little Indian always radiates joy, at least when he isn’t scolding
people. On one of our first meetings he just looks at me and mentally says,
“first go into silence, hear Om in breathlessness and then take note of its
tone.” I could hear the Om sound vibrating within and it seemed to
correspond something close to the tone of C. I got my flute out and played
a C and it sounded like I was playing at the same tone as the sacred Om
sound that was resounding around my pineal gland. Later he said, “Now
hear it in C-sharp.” My head went back and I started to lose contact with
the outside world and be absorbed into a great white silence that the Om at
C-sharp was taking me into.

When I came back down he said, “now what is in your mind?” I closed my
eyes and saw so many images and histories and stories flash before my
mind. He continued: “You will verify all of this in the next few years. It will
all come to pass.”

These events indeed are coming to pass, like entries in an apocalyptic diary.
It was the saddest story ever conceived, although the story should soon
change for the better. My friend could see the future and help his friends to
do the same. Spiritual experiences like this don’t happen so regularly as it is
too powerful of an experience for most to digest. The present is challenging
enough without knowing the future. Ignorance is sometimes a blessing, but
Pluma Blanca knew that it was necessary to understand these things.

<strong>Nahuatl</strong>

Pluma Blanca once told me that a Nahuatl is a healer that sees not just into
the minds of animals but also into those of humans. Beyond even seeing
into the souls of humans the true Nahuatl sees into the Oversoul, the
conscious substatum that unites us all. He says that to enter a human mind
is usually more difficult and dangerous than entering into a mind of an
animal. Humans are less innocent and their mental contents may make
such a rare and pure entity as a Nahuatl ill if he or she resonates too close
with other human emotional turmoil. Animals see us as gods and naturally
resonate with and reflect the mental states of their gods. The nahuatl
prefers to see the mere reflection of a human’s problems by “hacking” the
minds of the animals under their care. That way, the contact with the other
human mind is not too direct and doesn’t affect the seer and also the minds
of those seen into. Also,people often feel strangely transparent and often
uncomfortable when they feel that another can see through them. Animals,
like innocent children, may give very truthful and unbiased information and
just tell it like it is. Although a dog can’t speak, they reflect most of this
human resonance unconsciously and what lives and vibrates in the mind of
the master is also there in the mind of the canine disciple. A nahuatl may
learn many things about you through your dog, horse, or even donkey!
It has been said that very developed tantric yogis have the power of mind
over matter in that whatever they put their focused, disciplined minds on
will certainly materialize. Though quite rare, there have been numerous
examples of yogis with these bizarre qualities through the ages.
One day Pluma Blanca (White Feather) came to visit bon Nadie at Rancho el
Misterio. He spoke much of this phenomenon with practical examples. He
said that developed shaman really can even have some degree of control
over the weather. This amazed bon Nadie the most as Pluma Blanca was so
calm and unsensational while speaking about these abilities. Rather, he
took these truths very seriously. He always warned about these abilities,
however. “What if you lose control of an emotion and end up manifesting
your deepest shadow tendencies?,” he said. He was 110 years old and
never spent much time in the cities but he really did understand modern
people. The most amazing and diffult thing to believe is when he told bon
Nadie that Nahuatls (those who enter the minds of animals) are real and
that they can look into the Oversoul of humanity and into the Divine Eye
that sees past, present, and future. They can see all minds, not just those of
animals. He said that it is nice to see a human mind from time to time, but
he mostly just sees animal minds in human form.

On the way back south, bon Nadie took him to a store to buy some food for
the trip. It was an elite part of town. Most people had skin the same color of
bon Nadie’s. However, instead of the usual ignorance or normal sociability
toward his person, he noticed that some people gave him nasty, scornful
looks. They looked even worse at Pluma Blanca. Bon Nadie remained still,
just looking back at them. He was in a light, dreamy trance and saw so
much bad history, impunity, suffering and hateful prejudice behind these
people’s expressions. He was angry at their ideas and where they come
from but still couldn’t judge these superficial people, except to say that
they are superficial people.

One woman was particularly rude and pushed him to the edge of his
patience. She thought that bon Nadie was one of her kind based on
appearances. When he didn’t respond to her flirtations, she became
downright spiteful and said under hear breath, “maldito indio” or “damned
indian.” He wanted to respond and say: “because my heart is the same as
my friends, then I too am a damned indian.” However, Pluma Blanca came
over laughing and pulled him out of the store. “Let your wife pay, we will
wait out here,” he said. I knew that he knew I was a little annoyed. He sait
quietly for several minutes and then responded: “They will get their lessons
very soon.” Now Pluma Blanca was known as an oracle and I wasn’t sure if
he was speaking about the future of the world and all of the racists and
imperialists or if he was talking about this one woman in particular.
At that moment the racist woman came out of the store and Pluma Blanca
began to giggle like a small child. It was as if he had done something
naughty and was trying to hide it. A stray dog approached the woman,
raised his leg, and soaked her stockings.

<strong>Non-Dualism Cures All Disease</strong>

I have a friend, a recluse yogi, who has the ability to heal any disease. He is
still alive, but considering the state of collective insanity on the planet, that
could very well change. These big brothers have too much burden to carry
right now. So that a little dharmic, moral order can begin to influence
human society again, there must first be some major cleansing. He says
that people trapped in the human, materialistic urban matrices are
becoming physically and mentally ill due to the inability to harmonize their
physical, mental, and spiritual strata of existence with society, nature, the
planet and the universe. This recluse friend doubts if modern humans really
are fit to continue evolving on this planet. His opinion matters because to
me because I have seen him heal many incurable diseases simply by
looking at somebody. These people healed aren’t patients because he isn’t
a healer, at least he doesn’t consider himself one. They are just people who
happen to cross his path at the opportune time. I dare not give away his
identity or his whereabouts because the people would devour him with their
troubles.

He sees all illness as a projection of mental conflicts or imbalances. By
intuitively seeing the illness as distorted thoughts or repressed emotions
such as fear, anger, or insecurity, he sees how this flow of mental energy
interacts with the organs and glands of the body. Maybe this person can’t
tell you so much scientifically about the immune system, T4 cells, etc., but
he has been known to heal cancer. Maybe one can’t empirically verify how
he does it but it is easy to verify that the cancer disappeared. As a close
friend, I ask him how he does it. He doesn’t give away many secrets if one
isn’t first capable of understanding them, but one thing I have gathered is
that he has some way of taking these illnesses into his own being, like the
classic “sin eaters.” Perhaps the cancer of one person gives him diarrhea
for a few days, or AIDS makes him physically weak for a few weeks. His
advanced meditation and yoga practice constantly heal him of these
illnesses. If he stops meditating or spends too much time in the city with
the mundane, then he gets ill.

What he shared with me is that all illnesses are clusters of unprocessed,
unconscious thoughts and emotions that attack the physical body by first
creating imbalances in the glandular system. For him not to have the same
illness, he must process the thoughts and emotions of the other as if they
were his own. If he doesn’t understand these mental patterns behind the
illness, then his physical body suffers the same symptoms as the afflicted. I
can’t get him to tell me how he does it exactly. He is smug in his non-dualist
philosophy and simply says that there is only one being in the universe and
this being is only understood by the unprejudiced, tranquil and insightful
minds. By understanding this fundamental truth, the mind becomes free of
all complexes and relieves the body of having to bear the cross of all of the
ego’s ignorance and unconsciousness that create illness and disharmony.
He really can explain a little more, but prefers to let people figure it out for
themselves.

<strong>Form And Formless</strong>

“Brahma alone is the guru.” This saying from the Upanishad represents a
very universal conception of the deity. Brahma literally means that which is
great and makes others great. In other words, Brahma is the Consciousness
of the Macrocosm, of the entire universe. The guru is none other than the
Supreme Consciousness and cannot be tainted by partiality nor prejudices
nor any relative projection of a messiah or human guru. What is, simply is.
If the Supreme Consciousness can create this entire universe, then surely
there is an unmediated, direct way to communicate with me, a little
microcosm in this Macrocosm. “Am I a secluded figure, in the vast, a little
ameagre? No no no no I am not alone, the great is with me.”

And one could imagine that such a Macrocosmic deity is not a petty god of
a certain country or class or society of exclusive human beings that deserve
his mercy. The tiny little human microcosmic mind with its prejudices and
attachments finally understands that “god” is not to be found through any
finite form, material nor mental. The sacred books and messiahs and
Buddhas were just approximations of a an inner, mystical truth. Only those
who dare question the root of their being free of these appendages could
possibly find the root of their being free of all relative conditioning. Non-
dualism, or Advaita, is the idea that ultimately the consciousness of the
individual microcosm and the Macrocosm are fundamentally the same. This
is not to say that my consciousness has become the consciousness of the
universe, that the ego becomes god. Rather, my consciousness has been
taken into, accepted, transformed, digested, and finally assimilated into the
living, working consciousness of the Macrocosm or Brahma. The microcosm
is no longer a separate entity creating negative reactions and
contaminating the world while fleeing from one empty dream to the next.
The illumined microcosm is a mental cell unified with other mental cells
that form a Macrocosm, a collective body of minds. Here, one can’t bring
attachments, prejudices, nor any other petty ego control issue. The
moment they arise, the Macrocosm knocks you off of your feet. It takes
much time and evolution and trial and error to find a flow of unity into the
Macrocosm. One must unlearn the socially-conditioned and indoctrinated
ego along with all of its hereditary mental and biological instincts in order to
learn the ways of Brahma.

Only those born with developed intuitive faculties can understand these
truths without following teachers or paths. Life just somehow teaches these
inner lessons. I suspect that these minds are “primed” with this knowledge
from birth and that it was probably learned earlier. Plato saw all knowledge
as something that has already been learned. What we experience here in
the finite world are recollections of truths already known. Genius, according
to this view, is nothing more than having at one’s disposal what has already
been learned. Spiritual orientation is innately developed in some just as art
or music or mathematics is innately developed in others.</p> <p lang="es-
ES">The idea of a human guru or a spiritual teacher is to help one
understand these fundamental cardinal truths of non-dualism. A guru is one
who has walked that path and is capable of showing it to others. However,
most of the time, a concept of guru is but an opiate for a desperate
personality separated from the life of the universe due to its ignorance and
egoism. Belief is mostly desperate compulsion and the idea of a guru is
often a 2-edged sword. Normally, when people speak to you about gurus
they want to sell you on some idea. They often want others to bandy
together with them under some omnipotent messiah, guru, and their
religion or institution. They don’t really want to have their own experiences
but prefer just to adopt the ideas and traditions of others to find security
and refuge. The more absolute the idea, the more effective is the opiate
and the more placated is the compulsion of the fearful and separate little
ego to grasp on to some form of meaning

If one works through these limited ideas of a guru, then perhaps one can
really understand something of another human being that is wise and
compassionate and only has your well-being in mind.

I came to believe that Anandamurti was a true guru. I never met him in
physical form. I was convinced of his special character because of his
disciples. These exceptional human beings considered Anandamurti as their
guru and that naturally gives one a certain reverence toward their teacher.
There was once a Sufi teacher who knew of Anandamurti and respected him
greatly. He sent one of his disciples to see him. The disciple went to see him
but only saw an absurd show of dogmatic followers running about in an
absurd guru-devotee show. The master rebuked him and told him he was
only judging external appearances. What he should have seen is that the
master (Anandamurti) was so great that he accepted all people, even
clowns.

Fortunately, I made it past the show of spiritual salesmen and was able to
meet some of the more mature disciples of Anandamurti, both monastic
and lay. In general, the community of Ananda Marga was very respectable.
There were people from all strata of society working and moving together
under the inspiration of Anandamurti. The problems mostly resided with the
monastic institution after the death of Anandamurti. The more mature
meditators didn’t have any doubts about the divinity of their teacher but
were never dogmatic about it nor tried to impose it on others. They put
their meaning in doing practical work and sincere spiritual practice. Near
these mature disciples one could feel a certain lightness and expansion of
mind that helps one to realize that the guru is deep within, inside of one’s
deepest sense of peace. This influence made meditation much clearer and
peaceful. It seemed impossible to cling to any form of teacher when one
feels at one with the living Macrocosm of Brahma. I began to see an inner
light that radiated into every form that entered my mind. I saw the same
spirit both within and without. I became certain that I was not my body nor
my mind and so how was it possible to cling to some human guru form?
However, none of these elder teachers ever tried to impose this form upon
me and the stories that I well tell of them will hopefully help other people
appreciate the philosophy and spiritual practices of Anandamurti.</p> <p
lang="es-ES">When I first arrived at Ananda Nagar I met a yogi who told
me some very useful secrets. He immediately took me into his confidence.
He looked at me intensely and I felt like I was being scanned. The first thing
he told me was a tip of how to transmute sexual energies. I had never
heard a monk talk about things so openly, yet with such intelligence and
purity. Far from being perverse or hypocritical fantasies of a celibate monk,
it was the most practical insight into desire that I had heard of in my life. As
a young single man I greatly appreciated his insights. The second important
thing he told me is that some day Ananda Marga will probably end up killing
their own saints. He laughed heartily but he was serious. It was
inconceivable to me at the time. Furthermore, it seemed like heresy
because everybody else was only talking how great Ananda Marga was and
how Anandmurti left all of his power and grace in this organization! Now, 20
years later, I see what he meant.

Later, on another visit, he told me how yogis can leave their bodies and
travel through the inner dimensions of time and space. He said it was
another reality in which there exist not these relative factors of time and
space. It was a Dreamland that was even more real than physical reality, a
kind of astral repository of all human experience and memory-past, present
and future. He said that you could know whatever you needed to know and
meet whoever you needed to meet on this plane of reality. I was eager to
visit this Hall of the Immortals. He told me how to leave my body and at
what time of night I could do it. I left the conversation with a desire to see if
I could somehow know something of the teacher of these great men that I
was meeting and was inspired by. Later that night I followed the prescribed
technique. Nothing happened at that moment. Later I slept and then it
started to work. I awoke completely with a holy jolt of spiritual lightning in
my spine. I could feel the kundalini rising. I could feel it swishing through
the cerebral spinal fluid that was concentrating inside the brain. When it
entered inside the head there was only light and sound, every color was
within white and every sound within Om. All through the night there was a
whirling vortex of energy moving around the crown of my head. It had no
form, just sound and color. I was entirely awake but the more the kundalini
rose the more I entered into a very conscious state of trance. It was more
real than anything I had ever experienced. Rather than a world with forms
and mass, all was very fine and soothing vibration. I understood how the
crown chakra and the pineal gland were the microcosmic receptor and
channel to enter into the formless, infinite Macrocosm. Everything made
sense as pure idea. There was no fear or uncertainty of this unknown
reality. All was bliss and I felt quite free and pure. I realized that my body
was lying on my bed in a trance but that my consciousness was very clearly
in the Present without names and forms. Every once in a while I would see
the form of Anandamurti and the whole vibrational scene would turn into
something more like a dream, only much more real and lucid. I thought
“this is a dream”, but I knew it was a very special sort of dream. I still to
this day recall it just as clear as a “waking” state of consciousness.
To this day I am still trying to realize the significance of these detailed
conversations with the guru apparition. Perhaps it wasn’t absolutely
necessary for him to appear as a human to another human in a state of
lucid dream, but it was a very personal and affective touch from something
or someone very sublime. As the years pass by these revelations become
even clearer and life makes more sense. There was only so much I could
understand as a little spiritual fledgling in my early twenties. They were
experiences that by their very nature need a full life-time to be realized.
Although I have never preached or tried to convince others about the
divinity of Anandamurti, I have never ever doubted this influence in my life.
For so many years I didn’t even speak of him. It was a subtle struggle of
reconciling form with formlessness, and the idea that the guru archetype
may actually appear with a human form. I always considered the latter as a
relative possibility and never wanted my experiences to be some kind of
“proof” for the ego to make fixed ideas about the infinite. This is a subtle
error that causes great damage to an otherwise pure ideology, whether it is
one’s personal set of ideas or the ideology of a spiritual society. If mystery,
subtlety, and free speculationare substituted by concreteness and
conformity, then only dogma will remain. Human beings armed with
exclusive ideas always end up creating trouble for themselves and others. I
always try to refer to Anandamurti’s philosophical ideas that the Supreme
Consciousness is infinite and formless. With those who tried to impose the
absolute form of the guru, I only saw religion in the making and soon
learned that there was no sense arguing these matters. Over the years I
have taught formless meditation with an entirely different system to others
without referring to Anandamurti yet many of my students continue to have
similar profound experiences and dreams of Anandamurti. It is something
that only continues to grow silently inside of me and others. He himself only
said that he was, is, and will remain a mystery. However, the philosophy he
left is very clear, rational and lucid. I hope others find something special in
his works that I am sharing. They were compiled as books, but all of them
are based on talks that he gave over several decades to thousands of
people.

<strong>My Bodhisattva Candidates</strong>

Spiritual vision through the medium of mental forms is truly a form of divine
grace. It is a certain illumination and showering of elevated thought and
feeling that is designed by deep Intelligence to guide us onward and
inward. Form helps us eventually understand the formless, the quiet I-
Witness that is always now. Mystical vision is more than mere knowledge.
Through it, knowledge is conveyed but in the most beautiful and
meaningful manner. One could never throw such an experience away; each
time it is recalled one gets the original message and merges into silent
peace and joy.

I think Tarkovsky was the most mystical “image poet” of modern times in
that he really could convey deep mystical ideas through cinematic form.
When I see the last scenes of “Stalker” or “Solaris” I am deeply moved into
an ecstatic reverie and marvel over the experience for hours, amazed that
his genius could express something I always considered beyond expression.
That is true poetry. However, even this beauty is really only an
interpretation, and therefore limitation, of inner vision, which is always
ineffable. Great mystic artists give just a little bit of what they inwardly see.
Even Tarvovsky’s art pales in comparison to the truest, sincere vision of
even the most humble mind. The kingdom of heaven is truly within and
actively seeks prepared minds in its mysterious, inexhaustible variety of
manifestations.

The other day I woke up just before dawn, I sat up in bed and even before I
began to do a little meditation, I felt a strange vibration on the right side of
my head. Inwardly, I looked at it and felt it and saw so very clearly in my
mind’s eye a very gentle and friendly human form. I recognized him. I knew
that this was all going on in the “Magic Theatre” within so I asked this
apparition what he was doing here. No reply, just friendly, loving silence. I
reflected and thought “Yes, I know why you are here. Your humanism moved
me deeply and awakened something very profound but I have almost
forgotten its origins and how it came to me in this life. Your Dr. Rieux in
“The Plague” asked if it were possible to be a saint even if there were no
god. He sacrificed everything for the well-being of others, yet he didn’t
even believe in god. I always suspected this of you, that you could never
put your compassion under a popular concept of what we call “god.” Those
that didn’t grasp your depth called you an “Existentialist.” The actual
human experience of compassion was something so much more than
confusing, corrupt concepts. You initiated me into silent Buddha compassion
before I even became familiar with Buddhist teachings. I suspect that many
others were also helped by you, gentle angel who descended into the
“absurd,” the 20th century. Is this where you are now, in this ethereal
space, stimulating neurons of the incarnated so that we don’t forget love?
Do you dwell within the universal spirit, are you just a memory within the
collective mind of humanity still bound to this dusty earth, or just an
apparition of my idiosyncrasies trying to make sense of themselves?” The
apparition remains silent.

The form disappears and I feel that same gentle pulsation that was in the
left side of my head move into the right side of the chest, into the Spiritual
Heart. Through the Spiritual Heart, mind rises high into a very fine light that
surrounds the planet, a subtle, diaphanous spiritual atmosphere, I look
down upon my valley from so high in this ethereal space. Unlike being in a
plane or balloon and resisting gravity, everything is weightless and the
forms are of pure light. The only movements are pulsations of thought and
feeling. He came and showed me his perspective, how he sees things, how
the “dead” gaze upon us, and then returned into the formless. The rocks of
the mountains were just reflections of thought, all is sentient and made of
light. Life is inherent in all things. I could vaguely see human faces taking
form out of the mountain rocks. They are rough, turgid and unrefined like
Neanderthals but an invisible force keeps loving them beyond time and
form, purifying and refining them into something greater, beautiful and yet
to be completed. An immense love looks down upon the planet and waits
for all life forms to manifest and evolve spirit, slowly.
So was Camus a symbol or a bodiless mind that came to me? It doesn’t
matter. All phenomenal experiences of the mind, even the most spiritual
visions, are at best maps and guides, friendly nudges from the universe to
go here or there, or not to. The meaning of the vision is what is important.
To feel at one with the earth, as I did in this experience, is something so
profound that even though I write the vision of Camus off as an
hallucination, the inner meaning of the experience is indelibly pressed upon
my mind and I could never deny its beauty and sublimity. The vision
inspires great feelings, perhaps something akin to what the bodhisattvas
feel. Microvita are sentient intelligences that exist in the finer, mental
planes of reality. They have many qualities and manifest through various
forms of human nobility, valor, genius, and love. Did Camus express
compassion or did Compassion express Camus? For the non-dualist there
really is no difference. All souls are just sparks from the eternal fire of
Brahma. These bodiless microvita guide the evolution of consciousness in
all beings on the planet and even help shape our thoughts and feelings.
This physical world really is a reflection of the inner workings of spirit.
Imagination is the key to higher realities, and as Tagore noted, that with
more imagination, the less imaginary something is.

<strong>Neem Tree and Flute Tantra</strong>

<em>O yogi, sit in lotus under the sacred neem and together make impenetrable
conscious force with nature. The death troopers will receive a great blessing
from your practice. Infinite, white burning light penetrates and ignites their
darkness. An immediate reaction shakes their world. Those who dealt so
much terror may die in terror of Mother Kali, protector of the planet and of
yogis. The next embryo they inhabit will finish its recapitulation with gills
and fins. There they will “swim in idle waters and drink other fishes piss.</em>

Not many people understood the context of these phrases when I published
them with this photo last year. It was a very dark time and I remembered a
very dark punk rock song from my youth about reincarnation and how
Oedipus complex-ridden perverts are reborn as fish. I never thought
anything useful would come out of those memories but I realized that they
were quite insightful! The narco death soldiers had just returned to the
valley. They had come and gone several times in the last few years. Their
soldiers get killed off regularly and there were always new ones ready to
come and inhabit their nearby camp. There they keep hostages and then
kill them and throw their bodies in the mountains. I welcomed them back
with a solo of Gluck’s “Dance of the Blessed Spirits” on my kena bamboo
flute. I finished and they returned the message with gunfire. “Okay, now
you all want some of my oboe too?”

I truly felt protected and I didn’t worry. At first, I saw it as an ideational,
meditative stance to create a protective field around our territory so as to
keep their evil away. “As you think, so you become,” say the yogis. I won’t
even consider it a possibility that they harm us, and so they won’t.
However, as I continued to play and further pound them with Gluck and
Bach, I realized that I was probably playing requiems for their upcoming
departure from the planet. I thought of how those boys were probably
forced into the paramilitary part of the cartel and they probably weren’t
that different from the rest of the youth in the area. Human beings will do
almost anything under forced coercion, at any time and any place. Soldiers
hardly ever really know what they fight for. These boys are dying in a war
insidiously designed to make Mexicans kill Mexicans while the gringos
continue to rob their country blind. The plan is to let the locals do the
raping and pillaging while the imperialists purposely take advantage of this
situation.

After this realization, I played music for them not so much to scare them
but to try to send these poor souls something beautiful. If they really are
like the youth in this area, then they probably have suffered many
deprivations and have never really felt much human warmth and
compassion. There are very few nuclear families and almost all heads of the
household are alcoholics. There are almost no opportunities for these
outcasts. However, the system has designed a strategy to get rid of them
and make money selling arms and drugs in the process. They had already
entered the ranch on a few occasions in the past. They are used to people
being afraid of them. However, we decided to reprimand them. They were
terrified. They said they heard voices in their heads and wanted to leave.
They said they would give us their protection. “No thank you,” was the
reply.

I don’t recommend this technique unless one is very fearless and has a
really strong mantra! When confronting evil forces that could easily destroy
one’s physical being, one’s only protection is innocence and purity. There is
fear because there are impurities. We don’t yet fully understand that we
belong to immortality and so we attach our identity to some notion of
worldly temporality. Sadhana or meditation burns away the impurities and
leads one to a natural state of innocence, at one with nature and spirit.
“Who’s universe is this anyway, by what right do these narcos, their narco
state and puppet governors have to wield this terror upon us?”
Circumstances have given me proof time and again that the only true
protection in this world is to be at one with dharma, the moral order of the
universe. “Those who protect dharma are protected by dharma.” Dharma is
not about beliefs or religion but rather getting to the essence of things by
deep contemplation and then know how to react to the situation from this
pinnacled, illuminated perspective.

If for some reason I can’t concentrate in meditation, then a little spiritual
music or kiirtan always helps. Instead of letting the mind be conditioned by
terrible information coming from the world of men and their media, one
surrenders to dharma, the silent and natural flow of events in the universe.
One can truly feel the harmony of nature and spirit and that the force of
dharma, the conscious force of nature whose only purpose is to serve what
is pure and innocent. The best meditation is that which is totally
surrendered to Brahma; one desires nothing but simply enjoys being at one
with Brahma, the supreme entity. Similarly, the best music is that which is
played with spiritual devotion. While in meditation or playing music under
the neems or the nearby ceiba tree one totally gets lost in spiritual ideation.
With music and meditation along with the protection of the neems and
ceiba, one can do the necessary work and create a spiritually-protected
atmosphere. To always feel that the Supreme Entity is near and dear, is
always loving and looking over, dissipates all fear.

<strong>The Divine Mother</strong>

The year before last was at the height of this so-called narco war in
Northern Mexico. The narcos controlled the whole region and the local
village. There was a command center 2 kilometers from our home where
there were human skulls hung on the fence. Many of the local men were
hired as lookout scouts to inform them if there was going to be an attack.
The people in the village were very destitute and poor. Many families had
inadequate food and clothing while the men spent their money on beer or
crack.

Rancho Misterio began organizing some social service activities in the
community. We even organized a mass with a very good Catholic Father in
which the chanting of Baba Nam Kevalam was incorporated into a mass
which the father gave. Giitanjali continued to take our crew to sing kiirtan
twice a week with the community members. I usually stayed behind in the
ranch with the heavy artillery in deep meditation and confident that nothing
evil could befall my family. During that time the locals would pray to the
Virigin of Guadalupe before and after singing kiirtan. During those times my
meditation was so full of beautiful Christian ideas. I felt so closely the
divine, motherly aspect of the divinity. She never appeared as a form, but
rather the love that fills all space between all of the stars of the universe. At
that time I realized the Virgin of Guadalupe has a shawl bedecked with stars
and that the image is really a mix between an indigenous goddess and the
Virgin Mary. I never really knew much of Catholicism personally but always
knew many very good Catholic people. In my own way I had many internal
apparitions and it was nice to feel like I understood the underlying meaning
of the Divine Mother behind this image.

At that same time, there was an apparition of the Virgin of Guadalupe over
the village. Everybody who wasn’t drunk saw it; that is, all of the women
and maybe one or two of the men. What I learned from this is that the
divine cannot ultimately be trapped in any image but rather may use
images to express deep truths.
<strong>
Possession</strong>

I saw the first images of carnage during the first Gulf War my last year in
high school. I was disgusted and ashamed. Although most of the teachers
and leaders in society were supporting the government propaganda of a
justified attack, there were also a few dissenters in the public school system
who gave alternative views. I had been influenced by one such teacher. I
really had no strong political views but I learned just enough of modern
politics to entirely mistrust our government. At the same time a giant boil
appeared on my cheek. It was enormous and swollen and very
embarrassing. As the fluid oozed out all I could think about were the images
of the bodies of the hotel clerks in Bhagdad who were killed by misguided
guided missiles. I was ashamed to be an American. No more John Wayne
and heroic Green Berets saving the day; just filthy rotten imperialists and
duped, flag-waving morons robbing and murdering weaker societies for
their natural resources. Well, for several years at least I vacillated between
that extreme definition of my countrymen or the definition that they are
also victims exploited by bad education and capitalist pseudo-culture.
Either way, fascism always ends up taking hold of empires in the end.

victims exploited by bad education and capitalist pseudo-culture. Either
way, fascism always ends up taking hold of empires just before their
demise.

During the second invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 the boil returned in
exactly the same place. It was like a malevolent spirit that still haunted me.
I was no longer ashamed of being an American because I had become a
universal citizen by then. I really saw us as no more different than the
German population around the time of Hitler. However, I still had those
same feelings of disgust with the mindless American populace that
unwittingly goes along with the plans of the military industrial complex,
bankers and politicians that make all of this profitable war business and
propaganda possible. More than just a rebellious attitude against authority,
it was rather an attitude that these worms have no right to inflict this terror
on any human being, especially when the justifications for aggression are
based on crude lies.

I had just moved to Mexico in 2003 and met a young couple who were very
concerned about the war. They were intelligent, educated, and had a very
humanistic outlook. They had a new-born baby at the time and were a very
happy family. However, they were horrified at how the United States was so
blatantly pulling off this scheme that any reasonable intelligent person
unbiased by Fox or CBS could clearly see through. The wife seemed to be
deeply affected by the of war and was becoming even more so as time
went on. Although I don’t think they were actively protesting in the streets, I
did hear of them attending some social and ceremonial gatherings of a
pacific nature. Slowly she began to become depressed and withdrawn.
Nobody heard from her anymore. There was a Summer Solstice meditation
event soon afterwards in which we heard from other friends that she had
become very depressed, would not talk to anybody and was hardly even
interested in caring for her baby. Her husband was very worried and did not
understand what was happening to her.

She arrived and gave a faint smile to everyone. I hardly recognized her.
There seemed to be nobody at home. My wife took her into a back room of
the clinic away from all of the people participating in the festival in order to
talk with her and give her some naturopathic treatments. I could see her
husband was very concerned and was having to give a lot of time helping to
care for the baby.

About an hour later I was called back into the room. My wife asked me to
touch the crown of her head. She asked me if I could feel something
strange. I did so and felt a terrible, evil presence. It was similar to the
feeling I had with my boil but much, much stronger. I knew that this was an
evil too powerful to be coming from her. It was like a giant, super-personal
plasma blob of evil that was in the room. I felt sick and went into the next
room to lie down. Ten minutes later my wife came in and said her patient
was feeling much better. By that time I had already begun to decipher what
was affecting her. My wife saw that I was abnormal and asked me if I
absorbed something. I replied that I believe I had. My heart was pounding
as if I had run a marathon. I could distinctly feel another presence inside of
me. I had never felt like there was some other being existing inside me
before. Yes, maybe I had had some strange experiences with deeper parts
of my existence but it was always an experience with the various aspects of
my own self. My wife immediately lost her non-attachment as a healer and
began to worry about me. She wanted to take me to the hospital, which was
quite ironic because she always “stole” patients from hospitals before the
butchers took people’s organs out. She was crying and begging me not to
die. I laughed and told her to shut up because I am fighting for my life with
all of my force and the last thing I need is for my doctor to say I am going to
die!

I lied there all night listening to the suggestions of this dark entity. I knew it
was either it or I that would be alive in the morning. Fortunately, my life
was very full and vibrant and I didn’t accept any of the suggestions from
this evil. It was like a pattern that simply made everything negative and
distorted- pessimistic and destructive thoughts, hateful feelings, while at
the same time it siphoned the life out of the body. It was a contest to see
which mental pattern would control this body, the evil plasma or my own
conscience. I could now understand very well what was affecting our friend
and her family.

After a few hours I recovered a little. The woman had fallen asleep and I
went to speak with her husband. I was exhausted but said that I believe
everything will now be alright. He seemed a little relieved. I awoke with a
terrible headache. It stayed with me a week or so while this presence was
being digested. In the meantime the family learned meditation and we
spent much time with the baby and all was alright. It was the most terribly
illuminating experience I had ever had up until that point in my life. It was
the beginning of a live microvita study that has only gotten wilder as the
years pass on.
<strong>
The Tree Tantra</strong>

In the Tantra that I learned, Raja Di Raja Yoga, the techniques were very
effective in awakening the kundalini. I began to enter the breathless state
of samadhi very regularly when I was 23 years old. Although very intense,
the practices gave the mind and body the maximum amount of
transformation biologically, psychologically, and spiritually possible.
However, nobody ever effectively taught me how to bring the kundalini
back down. For years I was like a machine working at accelerated capacity.
Sometimes I would go into trances while driving and my friend would have
to grab the wheel. I would sometimes swoon and fall down while in a
spiritual mood. My body once leaped 2 feet into the air when the kundalini
awakened while I was sitting in the lotus posture. I cannot jump anywhere
near that high in lotus if I try with my best effort and even when using my
knees to bounce. This constant rising of the kundalini in me effected others
as well, mostly for the good, but also negatively as well.
I was immediately rejected from my yoga society after people knew I was
having these experiences. I was told on several occasions by several
monastics that I wanted those high samadhi states of realization, then I was
in the wrong organization. At first I thought this was absurd. I had only done
the practices that they had taught me. Samadhi, spiritual trance, is
supposed to happen when the kundalini awakens after sincere practice. It
would probably have been alright with them if they had these experiences.
Many talked about my experiences much more than I ever did within their
gossip circles. They finally admitted my experiences were real, but said that
I would die before age 40 because of their intensity. Far from being a
complement, they also wished more mundane misfortunes on me as well! I
felt like I was the lowest creature on the planet for a little while. While
receiving divine bliss on the inside, I received so much hatred from without.
There was absolutely no possibility of developing an inflated ego out of
these experiences because I was constantly negated by the slanderous talk
about me. Later, I did realize that I was in the wrong society. I knew I wasn’t
perfect but I wasn’t the narcissistic person that they made me out to be.
“What Peter says about Paul says more about Peter than it does about
Paul,” I realized. I left these practices entirely. The people who taught me
them hated me with such intensity that I felt tremendous pain in my head
each time I tried to meditate with their system. It was as if they had
suspended my access to Spirit through their channels. Fine, that gave me
an opportunity to find out what Tantra is really like, independent of
dogmatic religious groups. However, I have always held great reverence to
the teachers that I met who really understood their own practices. If I
would not have met these few exceptions, then I would consider my time
with this society as a prison sentence.

I left the shelter of a spiritual society without knowing how to bring the
kundalini back down, or at least to not be so intense and to remember that
this process will probably kill me if it doesn’t calm down. My renunciation of
this society was a great blessing, afterall. I realized that people liked me
again, despite that I had these strange phenomenon occurring within me. I
always felt liked and accepted for most of my existence and I feel that this
social acceptance gave me the confidence to be okay with myself and
begin to explore new territories of inner being. I felt more at home in a
hardware store than in a closed-minded spiritual society.
My meditation experiences came back with even more intensity and
originality. I gradually developed my own system of practice. Throughout
these years I never stopped having dreams of Anandamurti in which he
always told me very interesting clues. He never gave anything away, but
rather just guided me towards the understanding of spiritual practice. I
realized that I didn’t even need to meditate anymore but that Anandamurti
continued to give me experiences that would deepen my understanding of
meditation. It has been a great adventure.

During this time, I became friends with Pluma Blanca, a Mayan yogi from
Campeche. On our first meetings he shared his insights about the Tree
Tantra. He always sat in meditation under the ceiba tree. It reminded me of
how Anandamurti said that it is good to meditate under the neem tree.
 
One takes the tree as a symbol for meditation while at the same time
taking actual shelter under the tree and participating with its shield of
electromagnetic energy while meditating.  According to Mayan mystics "nothing evil can happen while under the ceiba."  The upward force growing out of the earth helps awaken the kundalini while the downward force of converting air into mass and developing deep roots into the earth helps bring the kundalini back down. Mind must fly upward toward the spirit but also must return to the earth, at least for as long as one is on this earth. Just like the Indian Yogis, Pluma Blanca said that a yogi completes his spiritual practice by bringing the kundalini back down, from the crown and back down into the spiritual heart. This gives a base for the mind mid-way along the spinal column. One can be joyfully engaged in existence here while remaining in a subtle state of being while at the same time keep oneself grounded and in the body. Like the great ceiba tree, one extends high into the heavens while also rooting oneself deep into the earth. Unchecked kundalini force will eventually liberate you but it can kill your body if not careful. One gets attached to spiritual bliss and experiences but must know how to balance them out. It is better to save that intensity for when it is really time to leave all work and thereby the physical body, and never before then. Like the Upanishad says, “Desire to live 100 years while working in joyful unity with Brahma.”


<strong>A Few Stories of Dada Iishvarakrsnananda</strong>

Dada Iishvarakrsnananda or “Dada I.K.” was my meditation and yoga
teacher when I was in Ananda Marga. He was the most humane and friendly
person I have ever known. I continue to admire his moral courage and feel
that his sincerity, discernment, and pure intentions are a great inspiration
for many.
This is a story he wrote the other day. Its setting is in an intense political
atmosphere in India after Anandamurti had refused to stop speaking about
PROUT, a decentralized economic theory that he propounded. The
communists in the West Bengal state government are attacking
Anandamurti and killing his followers while at the same time the Federal,
pro-capitalist government is also trying to ban his social activity. PROUT was
too transcendental for both the commie state and the Federal pro-capitalist
governments and Anandamurti was getting flack from both the Right as
well as the Left. Anandamurti’s institution, Ananda Marga Pracaraka
Samgha, was later infiltrated by the CBI (which is like the CIA, only Indian).
Many of his closest disciples betrayed him while others, like my friend
Iishvarakrsnananda, went to jail in his teenage years for refusing to
renounce these ideas even though he would have been given a presidential
pardon and release for doing so. Many of his friends were brutally tortured
and he himself almost died in jail but never renounced his principles. I have
never known men with such clarity of purpose as I have known in Dada I.K.
“I Still Love Them”. -Acarya Iishvarakrsnanada Avadhuta
Once Baba asked me if I had any questions. I had a question in my mind
that had haunted me for around 15 years or more. But I was always afraid
to talk to Baba. Either I forget that question or I was too afraid to talk
whenever I met Baba personally. The question was not very good. But that
day Baba was in very very happy mood and told me that I can ask any
question to Him. I got some courage to ask the question. The question has
made me very angry and upset. For some time I would jump out of the bed
due to anger and hatred towards some sanyasi dadas who went against
Baba and put Him in Jail. Sometimes my blood was boiling with anger.
I told Baba: “I went to Jail before you went to jail.” At the time I was taking
care Baba’s quarter in 1971 in Ranchi. I was LFT (Local Full-time Worker) at
that time. I was also Baba’s body guard. When Baba left for Patna after
Ananda purnima Dharma maha chakra I was travelling with Baba to Patna
by security jeep. However, in last minute I was asked to take care of Baba’s
quarters in Ranchi along with a few other volunteers. So I came down from
the Jeep . It was very painful for me to be separated from Baba. After a
month of the departure of Baba the police arrested 33 Margis (members of
Ananda Marga), LFTs and WTs (Whole Time workers), all on false charges.
Madhvananda and 14 other sanyasi dadas were with us during the arrest.
My Question to Baba continued, “did the CBI did not know about you as
Dharma guru? Those dadas had seen the power of spirituality,
demonstration, and power of Taraka Brahma. Those dadas told me many
spiritual stories about you. Those same Dadas went against you and made
false accusations against you. When I think about those Dadas my blood
boils with anger.” When Baba listened to my words, He became totally
peaceful. There was total silence. I never have felt such a silence in my life.
It was total peace. He held my both of my hands for a long period. He
remained in silence for quite a bit of time and then He told me that “I still
love them.”

All of my anger, hatred, and frustration was gone since that day. Baba used
to say that Paramapurusa (Supreme Consciousness) cannot hate anyone.
He repeated this several times in his talks: “Oh human being! what right do
we have to hate anyone when almighty Taraka Brahma does not hate any
one?” Baba used to say that “you may like or dislike someone. But do not
hate anyone.” Baba was Parama Purusha, Taraka Brahma, and Satguru.
Baba was a symbol of love. Baba is a symbol of love. Baba will be a symbol
of love. Baba came here to flood the earth with love. Let all of His children
work for spreading love. Love will unite us.
<strong>
THE POWER OF MANTRA AND THE POWER OF GURU</strong> Dada
Iishvarakrsnananda

Yesterday I wrote about a saintly Grhii Acarya (Married, Family Teacher),
Sakal Deva. Today I am writing about a serious incident which forced him to
join Ananda Marga. Acaraya Sakal Deva Dada was a fearless person. He
was lawyer by profession . His body was well built . I did not have a chance
to see him in his younger adult age but even at the age of 90 he used to
walk in an erect position. Before he was in Ananda Marga, people were a bit
afraid of him. He was bit rough and tough with people. He was not afraid of
any one or anything. One day he was walking on the road . He saw a person
in a black robe. After seeing the person, he became afraid. He was haunted
by fear day and night after that . He went to temples and other religious
places to overcome his fear. The lawyer who was known as fearless in
Muzaffarpur had become full of fear.

On one rainy day, he started to run and fell down and was knocked
unconscious. Some so-called low cast people in Bihar saw him lying
unconscious and brought him near a temple. Somehow these local people
knew about Ananda Marga tantric meditation practice in that area. They
told him that Ananda Marga meditation will help you. He got the address of
an acarya and went to see him but he could not find him there. The family
of the Acarya gave the address of another Grhi acarya. He visited him. The
Grhi Acarya was very lean and thin person . He wanted to overcome fear at
any cost. He wanted to learn meditation but he put some strict conditions
on his Acarya. His first condition was that he loves to drink whisky every
day. He must be allowed to drink whisky as he will die without drinking
whisky. He also eats meat at every meal. He must be allowed to eat meat
every day. I forgot his third demand. The Grhi Acarya was a bit nervous.
Sakaldev dada told me that to overcome his fear he wanted to learn
sadhana (meditation) even if he were to have to force the acharya to teach
him if the acharya would not have agreed to teach willingly. He would have
easily overpowered him because the acharya was so thin. He was adamant
to learn meditation. Finally Sakaladeva dada was taught meditation.. The
Family Acarya told him that you may drink your whisky and eat meat every
day, but you must practice meditation twice a day as well. In the Ananda
Marga meditation system, the Guru teaches meditation and the acarya is
just a medium. Now the job was taken over by the Guru. The power of his
mantra started to work. After few days of sincere practice of Sadhana as
per instruction of his Acarya, he went to eat his meat. Afterward, he kept
vomitiing and vomiting. The same thing happened with his desire for
whisky. When he went to drink whisky he broke the bottle with his bare
hands out of repulsion for the whisky. He gave up eating meat and drinking
whisky. He told me that when he went to court, he would always drink
whisky before making arguments in the court.. Such was situation of Acarya
Sakal Deva Dada before becoming a margii.. Acarya Sakaldeva Dada took
the shelter of Varabahaya (the blessing of fearlessness from the guru) and
all fear went away.
<strong>
Spiritual Journey and Struggle:</strong> Part 3 -Dada Iishvarakrsnananda

We were a half dozen people in the training center. I was youngest of the
trainees. We learned some basic philosophy, worker’s rules, etc. After the
training we had to do SPT (Sadhana Piitha Training). We got a piece of cloth
to wrap around us but no slippers, no shirt, no shoes. We had to keep
silence( Maona Brata) .We were not allowed to keep any money or any kind
of possession. We were instructed to go to beg door to door in the morning
and come back before noon. It was very hard thing for me; but I had no
choice.

I used to go far away from the town; so that no known person should notice
me. One day I went very far away to the tribal village. I had collected some
potatoes and rice. I used to utter 3 times “Hari Om Tat Sat” . If they gave
me alms; I took them, otherwise, I moved to the next house. I was not
supposed to talk and a say any words if some one asks me except “Hari Om
Tat Sat” while I was begging.

One day I was walking on a road when I met a man. He wanted to talk to
me, but I refused to talk with him. He continued and forced me to talk. I
explained a little bit about Ananda Marga. He told me that there is
gathering where around 50 people are sitting. “It will be nice if you come
there and talk to them about your philosophy,” he told me. I did not want to
go there, but he forcefully persuaded me to go there. I was alone and there
was no one else on the street. So I followed him.

When we arrived at the gathering people were sitting in a court yard and
drinking tribal liquor and in the other side some ritual was going on. I
wanted to leave the place and I told the person who had brought me there.
He told me that he can not do anything as the Sardar ( head of the tribe) is
responsible for this place. He told me to speak with the Sardar . I asked
permission from head of tribe to leave. The Sardar told me that “you were
brought here as a sacrifice to our Goddess. You can not leave this place.” I
was surrounded by many people and I started to cry on the inside. The
Dadas had told me that if there is any problem that I should use second
lesson of meditation. I started to take second lesson, but the mantra did
nothing. I was confused, but I did not cry. I was remembering Baba, but it
did not work. I started to think that I will be killed and offered to the
goddess and no one will know about it.

The complete memory of my life started to come back. Every one used to
love me. All my family members were so close to me. For some time I was
thinking about my father, sometimes about my mother, sometimes about
my brothers, sisters, and sister-in-laws. Before becoming a Margii everyone
loved me so much. I thought about my nephew and niece and how I used to
play with them. I started to think that my family was right. I should not have
joined Ananda Marga.

I will die and no one will know. No mantra, no Baba, no God was going to
help me. I was a heart-broken man. Death without reason was meaningless.
Every second I was thinking about death. I had lost all hope in God, Guru,
Mantra, tantra. I was just thinking about my death every second.
I had reached there around 8 AM. Almost eight hours had passed there.
They were chanting and sharping some axe and sword. I was watching and
counting my time. Next they brought some home-made tribal liqueur called
“handia”. I never had any kind of alcohol in my life. I refused it but they
wanted to drug me. I was helpless. Four people came and some one held
my hand, then some one opened my mouth and kept pouring liquor in my
mouth. I did not know how many bottles they put inside me as I was half
dead. They brought some rice to feed me but I refused, so again forcibly
they put rice in my mouth and I somehow swallowed it.

It is impossible to express my feeling about this unwanted death as I had
lost all hope. I had some potatos in my begging bag. One person came and
snatched my bag. He told me that he wanted to eat my potato. I gave it to
him. Then somebody appeared out of nowhere. He told the man who was
going to eat my potato: “do not touch that potato”. He further said: “do not
take food from a beggar. This person may be saint, a swami, or god on the
earth. If you take his things then I will smash your head.” The person who
was going to take my potatos asked him: “who are you?” He replied: “that it
is none of your business.” While this was going on a riot broke out. People
were very drunk and they started to beat each other.

The unknown person who had appeared told me: “run away from here!,”
but I had no energy to move. I was scared to death of the sharp axe and
sword. The thought of death was moving through my head as they can kill
me at any time. I did not move. The person again shouted: “run away from
here!” In the end he came to me, grabbed my hand and we started to run. I
was still afraid that they would follow me. We ran and ran until we came to
the main road. This person told me: “Go, go to Baba.” Additionally, he said:
“I will be here until you reach your place. If any one comes here I am going
to chop off their heads one by one.”

It was almost dark when I reached my place. Dada Shyamananada was
moving back and forth in front of Baba’s gate. When he saw me he became
very angry. He was very upset. He told me that Baba have not taken food
and water since the morning. He has told them if his son does not come He
will not eat and drink. I told Dada to go and tell Baba that I am back and
that I will narrate the whole story. He went to tell the news to Baba. After a
few minutes Dada came back and told that the food and water which was
for Baba has to be given to me. “That is instruction of Baba, there will be no
prasad today,” Dada told me.I had wonderful meal. I once told this story to
Baba when Baba had asked me how many times he has directly or
indirectly helped me. This story was written during Baba’s life in Hindi and
later translated into English.

<strong>
I GAVE THAT POWER ONLY TO YOU</strong> narrated by Dada Iishvarakrsnananda

I had written in a previous story that Baba had given power to Dada
Dasaratha to screen people to have personal contact. Dada Dasaratha used
to see the mental color of people and accordingly he used to either reject or
send the people for personal contact. Once a very important person came
to Jamalpur to have Personal contact.. He was sent to Dada Dasaratha for
screening. Dada Dasratha entered his mind and saw the person was unfit
for personal contact and so he rejected the person for personal contact.
However, some top official of Ananda Marga started to put pressure on
Dada Dasaratha to approve the person who was very, very important. Dada
was in a dilemma. On one e side were top officials of Marga and othere side
was Baba’s instruction. Finally, Dada Dasaratha went to see Baba. He told
the whole incident. Baba was furious., He told Dada Dasaratha that I gave
that power to you only to decide. Nobody else. Do not have to listen to any
one. In the end Mr. very, very important person did not get personal contact
at that time. Baba was a great master that he did not differentiate between
so called important people in society and an ordinary person. His rule was
the same for everyone. That was his greatness. Glory to Lord Shrii Ananda
Murti Jii.Param pita baba ki Jay.
<strong>
I WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE TO PLAY THIS DIFFICULT ROLE”</strong>

It was the year 1987 and I had came from Hong Kong sector to attend
Ananda Purnima Dharma Mahacakar. and RDS. I had a very good news
report. I was very excited. Most of the central Dadas were happy about my
good news report. But when Baba came to take report from usI was singled
out by for for poor productivity. Two other Dadas were also singled out. For
poor productivity a punishment was given. Negative microvita were put in
certain part of body. The first day Baba made some commenst which I did
not like. He asked all the Dadas to keep away from me. No one was allowed
to be with me and some were taunting. Some were allowed to make bad
comment. Some people were scolding for poor out turn. It was big drama. I
felt much pain from the negative microvita which were making my whole
mind negative. The next day again was same drama: shouting, scolding,
making fun. Taunting, etc. My mind was becoming very negative.
It was the third day when Baba ask me to touch the feet of all Dadas and
Didis. I did. I was asked to give a talk . Baba told me to give a talk on the
effects of negative microvita. He also told me that to tell people that if they
will not work for Marga then they will get negative microvita and suffer
tremendously. It was a very difficult situation for me.

Baba also said that I gave many talks in South Korea. In a similar I should
give a talk and convince everybody present to work for Marga, otherwise
they will also get the application of negative microvita. My mind had
became negative but I gave a talk although I was in pain. I almost became
mad. RDS was over. We all went back to our place. I was staying in the
Upper hostel. Around 1 AM SHUBHABUDDHANANDA.JI(VSS SG) and
KRSNATMANANDA woke me up without saying a word. They put me in Jeep
and I became afraid. They brought me Baba’s Quarter in Ananda Nagar. I
kept thinking the last three days that Baba has been informed wrongly
about me. GS dada was lying on the floor in front of Baba’s Door. GS Dada
was sleeping. He woke up from sleep and told me that I have been
transferred from Hong Kong sector to Manila sector in Bali (Indonesia). He
then said to go back to sleep. After that they brought me back to upper
hostel. I went to sleep. After Dharma Maha cakra and RDS the meetings
were over. I went back to Kolkata.

I wanted to meet Baba personally. I request Dada Keshavananda who was
Personal Assistant to Baba to get permission to see him, which I eventually
did. My mind was still very very negative when I got the approval, but I
became a little happy. I entered in to Baba’s room and did sastaunga
pranam to Baba and got up. Baba asked about the good news from Hong
Kong sector. I started to tell the good news. Baba became very upset and I
was asked to leave the room and I left the room Immediately. I was totally
shocked, pained, disturbed and confused. The question started to come in
my mind about this “good news.” When I came out of the room many dada
asked me about my meeting with Baba. I told them that Baba said nothing
to me in very angry mood whenever they asked me. I became very restless
and sad. This was worst test given by a Tantric Guru. I was walking like a
mad man in the Lake Gardens. One dada came to me and told me that
Baba wanted to see me again. I told him that I do not want to see Baba. I
was thinking Baba was going to punish me again. I saw Dada Keshavananda
was running towards me. He asked me to go to see Baba. I told him that I
do not want to see Baba. My Mind had become totally negative but he
grabbed my hand and dragged me and threw me into Baba’s room.
When I went in to his room Baba was in Kalyan Sundram Mudra . He said to
approach him. His voice was so sweet . It is hard to explain in words. Baba
said, “I was not able to find anybody to play this difficult role. You did it
best. I have to teach people. You have had to undergo much suffering in
this RDS. Come closer and sing me a song.” All of my negativity and the
effects of the negative microvita were gone. I was in a different world and
different mood. I sang a song but it was not Prabhat samgiita. It was song of
the 60’s that I had learned in Dharma cakra when I became a Margii in
1967. I liked the song very much. It was a popular song. I realized I made a
big blunder when I came out of His room. I should have sung Prabhat
Samgiita. But when you have become mind less, when you do not have
your own mind, then you can not decide wrong or right. Most importantly
Baba did not objected when I sang the other song in place of Prabhat
samgiita. It was very important for me to see Baba in the Kalyan Sundram
Mudra.

<strong>THE GURU’S ORDER MUST BE FOLLOWED</strong>

On March 5th,1967 five Dadas were murdered in Ananda Nagar by a
communist inspired mob. Baba made a committee of five members to meet
Jyoti Bashu who was then home minister of West Bengal. It was a united
front government ruled by Bangla Congress, a breakaway group of the
national Congress Party and the Marxist Communist Party. Our five
members were sent to meet the home minister, including Acarya Lalan who
was the first principal of our Ananda Nagar Degree College. When they
went to meet Jyoti Basu, the home minister, they were not allowed to meet
him and reported back to Baba. Baba asked a question to them. “Did all
committee members go to see Jyoti Basu?” The committee members
replied, “we all went except Acarya Sakaldeva.” Baba was a bit upset. He
said we must take Acarya Sakaldevaji with you. They all again went to see
Jyoti Basu to submit the memorandum. As per instruction of Baba All went
to see Jyoti Basu.They were allowed to meet him this time. They had earlier
violated the instruction of Guru by not bringing Acarya Sakaldeva and that
is why they were not allowed to see Jyoti Basu. The reason for removing
Acarya Sakaladevaji from group to see Jyoti Basu was due to some kind of
complex in the mind of the committee members. Acarya Sakaldev Dev
Dada had very simple dress. He was very simple looking person, although
by profession he was a lawyer. He was a family Acaraya (Grihi Acarya). All
others were well-dressed. Acaray Sakala Deva is no longer on this earth. He
was the acarya of Acarya Svarupananda Avadhuat, Acarya Sujiit Kumarji,
and Acarya Nirmohananda Avadhuta, among others. He remained in
Ananda Marga and kept working for the Legal Department until his death.
He was a saintly and very sweet-natured person. He was great devotees of
Baba. He spent some time with me in Delhi Baba’s quarter when I broke my
leg in 1999. I also spent time in south ex Delhi Jagrti. when ever I went to
India. I always had wonderful Satsanga with him. He is grand father of
Prasenjitji who is working with a university in the UK.
<strong>
Celibates and Sexuality</strong>

There is so much suffering caused by blind sexuality. So many women are
abandoned with children by men whose animal instincts soon pull them
elsewhere after a little sensory gratification. The trail of trauma for the
woman may continue as she must struggle to care for the child that have
been abandoned. Or perhaps it was her unfulfilled or frustrated desires that
caused the separtion to begin with. One thing is certain, and it is that there
are fewer and fewer examples of harmonious co-existence in human sexual-
emotional affairs. As a culture we have gone back into the stone age as
regards to sexuality; only we don’t have giraffs and rhinoceros to chase and
hunt down in order to channelize this energy and give us some relief.
Instead there is emerging a whole culture of permissiveness and even
indulgence. In truth, this distortion of the sexual tendency leaves many with
very little happiness remaining in marriage or interpersonal relationships.
Conversely, I see very little hope in “free love” and open relationships as
well. While some like the way it sounds in theory, I have always seen that
somebody always ends up getting hurt. What we need is love. Sexuality
doesn’t necessarily have to ruin this but it usually does if one or both
people lack insight into what emotive factors are really driving them deep
within. And it is only by going deep within and seeing these needs that one
can find fulfillment in sexuality and relationships. Very few people can
altogether transcend these needs. These people are very rare and very
interesting.

I had a very normal sexual orientation in my youth. Nothing was too
extreme, neither repression or expression. I had everything I needed to live
a happy family life by the time I was finishing the university: a good
companion, a good education, and strong adademic interests that inspired
future plans. However, I discovered meditation and yoga in my second to
last year,and then got initiated into a very serious tantric practice. The next
thing I knew I was single, just barely graduated the university due to lack of
interest, and was on my way to India to find more truth.
It was surprising to see how my sexuality began to diminish as I cultivated
these practics. I was still a normal heterosexual; everything still worked,
only the fire had died down a little. The fire was now kindling the desire for
deeper spiritual experience. In those days yoga was still a weird Asian or
hippy thing, and not the popular practice that it has become today. I knew
nothing of contemporary yoga. Fortunately, I learned from some very
sincere and serious practitioners from India whom I met at the university. I
was beginning to understand what these older yogis had told me: that with
meditation there is deep insight and this deep insight into the mind and
emotions helps one understand not just sex but all mental and biological
tendencies. Tantra Yoga was for me a “libidinal economy,” a way of
investing energy in other pursuits. If you put energy in place B, then it is no
longer in place A, the original place. As a psychology student I was very
well aware with the concepts of suppression and repression and the
illnesses and neurosis that they cause. Transmutation was a different idea,
however. I never studied this in school. Freud certainly didn’t grasp this
idea. Perhaps Jung and the humanists did, however. What impressed me
most about Tantra Yoga wasn’t elaborate, sophisticated theories, but the
practical results of converting physical desire into mental desire. And sure
enough, my intellectual capacity exploded the more I practiced yoga and
meditation and put on the laungota, the yogis loincloth. Surely you have
seen them; the “Tarzan apparatus,” or “organic chastity belt.” My mind
became so sharp, however I was no longer interested in intellectual
pursuits. All that mattered was finding the source of what was summoning
me to make all sorts of renunciations that I never thought possible. Maybe
there was some difficulty in the beginning when I was still in the university
surrounded by shapely co-eds. However, for the most part it was a very
sweet renunciation with promises of something greater. I didn’t scorn
sexuality. That would be a direct path to a repressive hell. I just knew that
there was something greater. The awakening of the kundalini is more bliss
than a thousand physical orgasms at once. And the lover in this tryst is
Infinite.

The only problem that I had with my new life-style is that I began to
become very sensitive to the environment around me. I began to feel
people very deeply. For example, instead of noticing that somebody was
sad by the tone of their voice or facial expression, I began to feel their state
of mind. I would see somebody from far away on campus and get an
impression about their state of mind. What was especially difficult was
when I had to share a room with another person. I always dreamed of their
inner life. I shared my dreams with them and they were really grateful for
the insight into their issues. I once dreamed that I was in a love affair with a
girl from Vermont. We met together in a barn and.... When I awoke I was
perturbed because I hadn’t even thought of sex for several months. I asked
myself “why Vermont? What do I have to do with Vermont? I remembered
that my room-mate was from Vermont. I asked him if he had a lover there
recently. He just snickered and said, “you caught me!” I was always very
sociable. However this new energetic sensitivity began to isolate me a little.
However, I had already decided that I wanted to be a monk and accepted
this solitary yet blissful position in life.

By the time I graduated and arrived in India I was having very intense
kundalini experiences. Nobody understood me except my mother and a few
close friends. That soon changed when I arrived at Ananda Nagar. I felt like I
had arrived at a very special learining institution. It reminded me a little of
Hesse’s “The Glass Bead Game” only these men were mystics instead of
intellectuals. They did practical work as well. The yogi whom I spoke of in
last week’s essay administrated a university in the day and meditated all
through the night. It was good to have a reference for work because I had
only spiritual desires and didn’t want to do anything else. He was a very
advanced meditator and passed through spiritual passions that lasted
several years in which he did very little work on the physical plane. Instead,
he was absorbed in the bliss of samadhi. It is not that he was useless in
these times. Quite the contrary, his elevated vibration inspired many, but
also made his little monastic brothers a little jealous of his spiritual
achievements.

This monk had told me his secrets of transmuting sexual desire on one of
our first encounters. He said that he never repressed anything. I could see
that this was true as he was very outspoken. He openly criticized the crusty
theocracy around him and told me with a hearty laugh that Ananda Marga
would probably end up killing their own saints some day. He was bold and
always expressed himself openly, especially when stubborn or dogmatic
people needed a little kick in the rear.

He expressed his ideas about sexuality in a similar manner. If a women’s
breasts appeared in his mind during meditation, he just let it happen. He
knew it was impermanent. He would struggle with the image in his mind,
then let his mind enjoy the form. He still continued to do his meditation
during these intrusive “fantasies.” Slowly his state of formless bliss would
return. He said that eventually he would feel compassion for this person
and felt that if this desire manifested he could really harm another person
emotionally because he was so god-intoxicated. He knew that these were
momentary inclinations and that for him to take a lover would be a
disastrous existential manuever. This inspired him to embrace her within a
radiant white light and to tell her she was dear to the divine and that he
would never harm her. He said that in the end he always saw his “lover”
merging into the pure light of the eternal Atman, and returned to his
peaceful meditations.

What he told me weren’t some exact, specific techniques to make a desire
disapper. Rather it is an attitude and way of life in general that works to
transform the mind and body with their desires. Few people understand the
deep reasons for spiritual discipline and what the yogi truly wants to
achieve. This monk was a robust, intelligent, and even handsome person.
He would have had no trouble impressing the ladies. He was a far cry from
the creepy, repressed preist that negates himself through repression and
thereby degenerates his libido into dark perversions. I truly believe he had
developed the “heroic” state of meditation in which there remain very few
desires and one thereby begins to let go of all inhibitions. “All things come
from god, how can anything harm me?” Althought this is the attitude of the
“heroic” yogi, it is also the motto of the sensualist who loses his/herself in
these very same tendencies. Very few people can really become detached
from desire without butchering themselves up on the inside with
repressions and distortions.
