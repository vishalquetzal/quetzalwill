<strong>Books on Tantra Maya by Vishal Eckhart </strong>


My books are published on this site in their entirety.  The links to them are below.  I use my essays, books and music to raise money for my wife's projects to help the indigenous communities of Mexico. One can see her work on <a href="facebook.com/clinica.misterio"> Facebook.</a>  One may "donate" or purchase a book by clicking "Pay With Card."  The payment service we use is Stripe, which is very similar to Paypal. Payments are made directly to Stripe through their secure connections. (Stripe.com)  If one would like to donate another amount for the books, music, or our social service activities with the indigenous communities of Mexico, then one may make a deposit directly into my account in their preferred manner.  However, if you are really interested in having the .pdf version but are unable to donate, then that is alright.  Elmisterio.org is not a business, but a service.
