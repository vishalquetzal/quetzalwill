Nothing stops my friends at Rancho El Misterio.  They safely passed through all of the military and police check points where goods intended for the communities effected by the earthquake are stolen.  A truck ahead of them with relief supplies was robbed and assaulted. They also dealt with earthquakes while distributing the goods.  They finished their journey with a truck load of food, medicine, and other supplies for the shelter in Acteal, Chiapas, a project that we help regularly.  

I use my essays, books and music to raise money for my wife's projects to help the indigenous communities of Mexico. One can see her work on <a href="facebook.com/clinica.misterio"> Facebook.</a>  If one would like to donate for the books, music, or our social service activities with the indigenous communities of Mexico, then  people may make a deposit directly into my account in their preferred manner.
