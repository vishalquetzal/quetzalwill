In Tantra Maya there is only one vortex. It is what corresponds to the Sahasrara Chakra in Indian Tantras. It is called Hunab Ku, and is considered the center of the creation.   All of the other vortexes located along the spine are but worlds of vibration, of concentric circles that orbit the cosmic nucleus of Hunab Ku. All things come from this cosmic nucleus, just as all comes from the Shiva-Shakti godhead in Tantra.  Sahasrara means a “thousand-petaled lotus.” There are 50 vrttis in the microcosmic mind. They can express themselves in 2 ways; internally and externally. These two movements are the 2 petals of the Ajina Vortex, which is really a part of the Sahasrara Vortex. This is another good reason to remember how all vortexes are sub-vortexes of the higher ones. These 100 distinct vibrations are the causal fields behind the 5 sensory and 5 motor organs. (100x10=1000). There are therefore 1000 petals or vrttis that govern the microcosmic mind.   The Sahasrara lotus is the matrix where all vrttis come from. It is where the microcosm unites in the Macrocosm. The 2 propensities at the Ajina Vortex are related to the microcosm, but are of the Macrocosm. Here, there are no propensities of the microcosm, just the Macrocosmic mental matrix that controls them. In Tantra Yoga, the Sahasrara Vortex is considered the abode of Shiva, where Shakti, as kundalini, has subsided her activities of Generating, Operating, and Destroying the universe. The Sahasrara, therefore, is a divine center that is capable of controlling the entire mind with its 1000 “cosmic vrttis.” They are “cosmic” in the sense that these very fine “strings” are played only by the devas, or “gods” that regulate the entire cosmological order. So, the Tantra Maya concept of Hunab Ku seems to correspond with the Tantric notion of the Sahasrara Vortex being a vehicle for the Macrocosmic Mind of Brahma to govern the microcosmic mind.
	
Like all vortexes, it is a construct in the chitta that has a correspondence with the physical body. The Ajina Vortex is related to the pituitary, “master gland.” The 2 petals of the Ajina control the pituitary gland, which controls all other glands below. The Sahasrara is related to the function of the pineal gland. It is only the pineal gland can control the pituitary gland directly. A nice dose of melatonin secreted by blissful meditation can really placate all of the activities of the pituitary. And if the pituitary is controlled directly, then all of the glands in the body are affected by the pineal gland. All desires are therefore controlled by ideating on Brahma through the practice of sadhana. I like using the model of one vortex because it follows in form the cascading effect of the higher glands over the lower. Chakras, like glands, are a hierarchical network that regulate our emotive and cognitive states of being. I think of them as one vortex in the crown with so many concentric circles within. Chakras are just the subtle counter-part in the “quantum mechanical body,” or mental, subtle energetic level. Although yogis with concentrated chitta can find any nerve cell in the physical brain, the subtle vortexes are used to regulate brain and endocrine function. While the shaman seeks to induce mystical states through the science of mystical plants, Tantrics can learn to induce even deeper states of awareness by ideating on Shiva as the I-Witness within the Sahasrara, and indirectly create a divine state of intoxication. Through Tantra sadhana one intuitively fine-tunes a very subtle neuro-endocrine balance. Besides being drunk with infinite joy, this fine-tuned brain will naturally be more alert, intelligent, sensitive and conscious due to these practical effects of sadhana.
	
Every layer of mind is dependent on the layers above and below it. The vrttis of a particular kosa compensate and integrate the vrttis of the kosa, or mental layer, beneath it. At the same time the mind is unconsciously being prepared, through the unfolding of new propensities, for the unfolding of still higher compensations and integrations with successively higher vrttis. No state of mind is permanent and stationary. Each kosa is part of the great design of the Cosmic Mind. It is a system of concentric circles, vortexes, or wheels of energy vrttis whose cosmic symphony is ultimately conducted by the I-Winess. The vortexes, the devas who control the vrttis, and the endocrine glands do not exist for themselves, but are links within a greater whole that serve a greater function. This function is the realization of the Infinite.
	
At the Ajina Vortex the mind realized that its essence isn’t within mind itself, nor any of its cognitions. Free will may exist, but any notion of freedom within the mind will be conditioned by the Macrocosmic Mind which contains it.  True freedom is deep within the Sahasrara in the I-Witness of Shiva. Recall that mind is a "functional, ever-changing, and relative entity." At the Ajina, mind is understood as a functionary extension and creative outpouring of the infinite and eternal Shiva. At the Sahasrara Vortex the mind has reached this final destination. While with all of the other kosas there was a transmutation of the vrttis into successively more refined states of cognition and feeling, the move from the Ajina to the Sahasrara represents the complete dissolution of mind itself. It is not the case that the mind takes refuge in a higher order of mental functioning, like in the lower vortexes. Rather, it unifies with its fundamental essence and origin, Shiva. It is here that the binding forces of Shakti have relinquished the mind from created objectivity and that mind, the subtlest creation of Shakti, can merge back into Shiva.
	
This release of the binding forces of Shakti translates, in human terms, as the release of the "I" from any sort of bondage: pain and pleasure, birth and death, loss and gain. The “I” has become the I-Witness. Mahat is converted into Shiva.  Here one realizes that the Self is infinite, unchanging and eternal; it never underwent any changes or bondages. Actually, it is not even possible to think these thoughts here. Can the drop of water in the ocean speak of how it is one with the ocean? Is there still a drop that can say this or has it become the ocean? In Tantra this state is called Moksha: the complete emancipation from any bondage and the merging with Brahma or the unqualified Shiva-Shakti godhead. This is a state beyond existence, beyond the universe, and even beyond Brahma: the generator, operator, and destroyer of the universe. It is the eternal state of rest and refuge for those minds finished with the cycle of birth and re-birth.
	
Previously described was the eternal state merging with Brahma with no return. However, it is possible to temporarily suspend the mind in the Absolute and then return to the mind and body. This is not Moksha, because it is not everlasting. This experience of the temporary suspension with the Absolute is called nirvikalpa samadhi. Much more could be said about nirvikalpa and other forms of samadhi, but what is important to understand here is that the unconditioned and uncreated Brahma can be experienced without the death of the physical body and dissolution of mind. It is possible for the mind to come back down into a refined identity at the Ajina, while experiencing nirvikalpa regularly until the natural life of the body is over. At that time, one may attain Moksha and merge with Brahma in the Shiva-Shakti godhead.
	
Prana, the subtle energy that functions between the mental chitta and the physical nerve cells, gets suspended during nirvikalpa samadhi. The breath stops, the heart almost stops and the mind ceases to function without the pulsation of prana that always flows with the breath. During this phase before blissful oblivion one can tactually feel a warm glow around the pineal area in the brain vibrating Om at the tone of C-sharp. The blissful feeling also descends into the Anahata like a cool balm. All is sweet, one sees the immortal Self as it always has been. Memories of your past become memories that the Self had while diving down into your every unforgettable memory. The infinite being has always lived your life and sees your every memory from the eternal now of the I-Witness. It fully loves and accepts and absorbs you because you are It now. Then one forgets everything and realizes that one has not breathed nor been conscious of the body nor the outside world for perhaps several hours. I have known cases of yogis who suspended their breath in samadhi for 10 hours. This is experiential proof of nirvikalpa samadhi and of immortality the Self who is verily the great Brahma. In this experience first there is Om, the bliss, the the opening of Hunab Ku, and then the silence and breathlessness in union with the mystery of mysteries. In perfect equilibrium, the entire entity of mind and thus the entire phenomenological identity is suspended in the Shiva-Shakti godhead.
	
When I had the great privilege of meeting the sage Chandranath that experienced nirvikalpa samadhi every time he sat for meditation. I asked him how it was possible to remain in physical form if one is constantly merging into the Formless. He told me that he makes a determination before the experience of samadhi that he will return to his mind and his body and continue to help others as long as his physical body endures. Thus, he created a samskara, or subtle desire that keeps the mind bound to our world. It is this great and noble determination that kept him from attaining Moksha before his cycle of existence was complete. He will be remembered as the greatest sadhaka of Anandamurti.
	
Some beings that are liberated from their samskaras may choose not to completely dissolve their minds at death by attaining Moksha Instead, they hold onto the determination to serve and help all beings find this liberation. This determination leads to re-birth, but a Bodhisattva birth without losing the spiritual liberation already attained. Such persons are born free and the only purpose of their birth is to help others out of bondage.
