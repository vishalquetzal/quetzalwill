### Ch.1 The Elipse and Hunab Ku

Everything in this universe is in constant change.  The Vedas call the universe jagat, that which is in constant movement.  As the whole universe is in movement, nothing ever remains the same.  Perfection is a transcendent ideal not to be found in the physical, changing universe. Euclidean forms only exist in the realm of imagination, and not in the physical world.  Einstein has even shown that the path of a photon is not direct as its trajectory curves toward large, gravitational bodies like a star.  All things in this Macrocosm interact by pushing and pulling on each other.

The Vedas also speak of how the universe is elliptical, like an egg.  The orbits of planets around celestial bodies as well as the orbits of moons around planets are all elliptical.  Gravity is a polar force.  There are both centripetal, or center-seeking forces, and centrifugal, peripheral-seeking forces.  Sometimes the centrifugal force is greater, and sometimes the centripetal force dominates.  In the case of celestial bodies orbiting a star, the centripetal force is greater when the radius of the orbit is closer to the star.  The centrifugal force dominates when the planet is at its greatest radial distance from the star.  The relative existence of anything in this creation is determined by the balance of centripetal and centrifugal forces.  If the centrifugal force is too great, then a celestial body may be released from its star or planet and flung into outer space by its centrifugal force unchecked and balanced by the centripetal, center-seeking force.  If the centripetal force is too great, then the celestial body will be absorbed into the greater body that it orbits.    All depends on the balance of these two opposing, yet complementary forces.

In the philosophy of Tantra Maya, like that of Taoism and the I-Ching, or Book of Changes, this basic idea of polarity is seen as an underlying principle in the Macrocosmic creation.  These are binary systems of thinking in which balance and insight are attained through the subtle understanding of the relationship between the centrifugal and centripetal forces, the yin and yang, respectively.   One can also call the centrifugal force the “positive,” outward-moving force and the centripetal force would therefore be the “negative,” inward moving force. 

The mystically-oriented Mayan astronomers, through very deep meditation, unified their minds with these fundamental forces to understand the Macrocosmic workings of these forces and their relationship to the physical universe.  Seeing from beyond Time in inward meditation on the Cosmic Nucleus, or Hunab Ku, they were especially insightful about the phases of the elliptical orbit of our solar system around the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.  So many people nowadays are turning toward these ancient systems of understanding to try and find a deeper meaning and relationship of human life with the Macrocosm.

Any ellipse is formed by the adjustment of centrifugal and centripetal forces.  As a planet moves around this ellipse there are various seasons of the year.  Certain nature mystics, like the Mayan astronomers. also noticed that there are subtle effects on the planet’s gravitational fields which, in turn, effect not just our biology but our psychology as well.  Our minds naturally find a comfortable association in the understanding of these phases and the most insightful minds always see natural phenomenon as the lode-star for all human happenings.  In short, we are much more connected to everything than our conceptual minds can understand. Everything depends upon our lived, intuitive connection with the living, jagat, moving universe.  Poetic Seers  like Rumi, Tagore and Shakespeare understood these truths and expressed them so naturally in their words and song.

Any ellipse in the Macrocosm has a controlling nucleus, a Hunab Ku at the Consciousness Center of the centripetal-centrifugal dualistic interplay. In Indian tantra, the Cosmic Nucleus is called Shiva. This work will use the concepts and terms of Shiva and Hunab Ku interchangeably. The Cosmic Nucleus intervenes in this natural energetic interplay to Consciously bring orbiting ellipses closer to its center.  Shiva’s eternal responsibility is the balance of the entire Macrocosmic Order of the living, conscious universe. Hunab Ku or Shiva exists within every microcosmic heart and mind and is the aim of our process of evolution.  Every heart and mind, consciously or unconsciously seeks shelter in the grace of union with the Cosmic Nucleus.  This Cosmic Nucleus is ultimately beyond any energetic duality.  Shiva remains the Witness, the Commander Zero beyond all things multiple.  Thus, Shiva controls all of the vibrations from its nucleus, which are his devas.  In the physical world this subtle Energy or Shakti manifests as gravity with the centrifugal-centripetal interplay.  The subtle devas ride these elliptical waves and give a few  gentle, invisible pulses on cruder, electromagnetic fields.  In the mental, conscious world in which we inhabit, Consciousness is always present whether the mind is in close proximity, or whether the centrifugal force has taken the mind further from its central nourishment in the subtle beauty of Shiva.  The science of Microvita requires the attempt to put all of one’s vigor- physical, mental and spiritual- into this Cosmic Nucleus.  Shiva is the heart of all hearts, the reason of all reasons, and is within every microcosmic crown.  From here, in this center the inner-I sees only the radiant white beauty of the Himilayan Shiva or the White Feather of Hunab Ku.

Every object that exists was created by gravity and everything that exists has its gravitational center. The earth revolves around the sun and the sun around the galaxy and all galaxies pull on each other. What is meant by the term “Cosmic Nucleus” or Hunab Ku is not a physical nucleus like the planet, or sun, or galaxy, but rather the cosmological hub from which all of this creation springs forth. If all that existed were material and with a material cause, then this nucleus might have a physical, gravitational center. However, through spiritual contemplation and meditation one discovers deep truths of perennial wisdom; that the body and this physical universe is a relative play of consciousness in time and space but internally and essencially we are all intimately linked to the Cosmic Nucleus. Therefore, it is Consciousness that is the true Cosmic Nucleus. Consciousness is the center and essence of all things created. When we speak of the Cosmic Nucleus it is rather the hub or nuclear consciousness on which revolves all activity, be it the sublime activity of the mind of Brahma or the idleness of Mr Nobody.

It has been said by great seers of the “perennial philosophy” of all times and places that the Supreme Being is always with us and that we are co-creators or microcosms in this vast universe or macrocosm. Although many proclaim this great truth, it is much easier said than lived. The external world with all of its demands and uncertainties seems much more real and concrete than this apparently abstract spiritual idea. So we compromise ourselves with this relative world and place our spiritual lives on hold until we have time for meditation and spiritual practice after first securing ourselves in the “practical world.” With such a limited idea guiding one’s life it is very easy to lose one’s higher ideals as they give sway to material pursuits and eventually lose momentum over time. The mental projections of external desires, conformity and conventionality take the place of the soul. The only thing that brings us back to our souls is the fact that this world is never enough. Although family, work, creativity and a love for this world may be very deep pursuits, they are limited and ultimately mean nothing if not sustained by the Cosmic Nucleus. We all yearn for nothing more to bask in this light.

This light radiates down to purify our every distortion and shadow we have created along evolution’s way. The faithful and patient mind turns inward and moves upward toward the Infinite and experiences an eternal deja vu feeling of having arrived at a home so well-remembered but also forgotten. This Cosmic Nucleus is always so near that we don’t even notice it. Its not somewhere off behind the Playedes or Orion constellations, nor is it in some heavenly realm beyond our access. It lies hidden within one’s very feeling of existence, of “I exist.” The Cosmic Nucleus is the “I-Witness,” the entity that witnesses, that is the base for the I-feeling. It is not the little “I” or ego but is the fundamental awareness behind all ephemeral expressions of the “I” consciousness. So to know this supreme knower is not to know it as some fact or place or object for the mind. The Upanishads ask, “how can the knower be known?” Consciousness is not an object for even the finest philosophical speculation; It always remains as the Supreme Subject. If it is truly the I-witness, then the path must begin with awareness and responsibility of the notion of “I exist.”

Most people belittle the existential I-feeling by confusing it with the little “I” or ego. The “I” is pirated by the separation and fear of the notion of limited existence in a hostile world that keeps us bound to materialism and low instincts. Spiritual practice is the beginning of the introversion of the mind’s activities toward the I-Witness. Instead of focusing on some philosophical idea, absolutist religious ideal, or conceptual form, the spiritual aspirant focuses the mind with the question “who am I?” and begins to focus and feel what the I-feeling really is. It is such a deep path with so many levels. There are so many latent feelings and thoughts that come out in this process, but it ultimately leads to a purification in which we feel the purity of the I-feeling is without limits. “God” ceases to be a concept but becomes the Eternal Now, the immediate presence of consciousness behind my “I”. And it is only when this feeling of “I” is free from limited, egocentric thinking and feeling that one discovers the inherent bliss of existence; that existence has never been something separate but has always been a source of bliss awaiting all microcosms on the path of spiritual evolution. The difference between the our inner, quiescent “I” and Shiva is so fine, almost non-existent, like the line between shadow and shade. And such is our union; the microcosm begins to reflect itself as an image, a replica of the Macrocosm. The restless monkey consciousness awakens into the divine. Will there someday be no difference? So we must learn to trust ourselves and listen only to Om, the voice of Shiva, within. No matter how far the orbit of mind is away from the Cosmic Nucleus, it is only Here in its immediate, conscious presence that the infinite riddles of existence begin to be resolved.

I was first introduced to the concept of Microvita in 1993. Anandamurti had just left his physical body a few years before. People hoped that he would have been able to expound further on this new, revolutionary subject that he only began to speak about in the last few years of his life. However, he was able to establish a certain theoretical framework for very intuitive minds to study. This theoretical base helps orient the inquisitive intellect in the right direction. According to the great Tantric preceptors, like Anandamurti, there are subtle methods and theoretical models, or pratima, that are created by very intuitive minds with the design of helping the conceptual and creative minds of the students to delve into the secrets of the intuitive mind. 
	
If it weren't for this theoretical structure, then the science of Tantra would be as loosely defined as any other experimental, shamanic system. Tantra undoubtedly has its pre-historic roots in practices akin to shamanism. It is said that the great Sadashiva systematized this very free, experimental, and non-centralized practice of pre-historic Tantra indigenous to the Indian sub-continent. Tantra then became a more methodical and systematic form of spiritual practice designed to expand the mind from the dullness of materialism and instinctuality. Throughout the ages the great sages have revived this ancient science, each in his or her peculiar way.  Anandamurti was a modern reformer of this Tantric tradition as well. He re-systematized these practices to make them more applicable to the modern, universal human culture. They are very subtle, yet sure and solid practices that anybody with a little discipline and spiritual awareness can begin to practice. For more advanced meditators he gave special types of meditation for the study of microvita. 
	
I have always been fascinated with the ideas of Microvita. I met some very developed yogis who had made some very great advances in these studies. Most successful were the most pure and spiritual meditators. Many of them didn't have complex, conceptual minds that could give a rational explanation to a physicist, for example. However, there were a few of them that did have this spiritual insight combined with a developed conceptual mind that could give a very clear and logical explanation to intellectuals conditioned to think with scientific methodology. All of these yogis influenced my thinking and my desire to know more. Knowledge of Microvita isn't essential for spiritual realization, just like knowing how to fix a car isn't necessary for one to drive a car. However, this science does have some very practical applications in the sciences and arts. Most importantly, is the understanding of how our deepest intelligence is really embedded in the Tao, the Macrocosmic Mind. 
	
I came to learn of the Tantra Maya practices in a very curious manner.  One summer I passed through very deep and intense meditations.   It was during the most intense and horrific times of the so-called “narco war” in Mexico. The terror only pushed our community further into our meditations to try to survive and mentally and spiritually process the absurdity of war. Taking the stance of warriors, we decided not to let anything affect our determination to continue with our spiritual lives. One day, while in deep, still silence, I started to see all kinds of images arise in my mind.  They intruded and interrupted the silence, formless and breathless. Awakening back into my discerning mind, I immediately recognized these thought forms as Mayan symbols.  While these symbols appeared I felt like there was some guide or professor explaining the deep significance of each of them- the pyramid, the ceiba tree, as well as many peculiar sounds and meditation mantras.  There were few images, but the explanations were so vast.  Perhaps these ideas only lasted a few moments but they were packed full of deep, meditative ideas.  I continued enjoying these inner sessions thinking that I was simply tapping into the store of collective memories, or akashik records.  Thinking that I had discovered some secret Mayan yoga, I told my daughter about them.  She laughed and said they were all practices that she had learned when she was 7 years old from her Mayan teacher, Quetzal Manik, or White Feather.  Around that same time we got word that Quetzal Manik had just passed away at over 110 years of age. 
	
Most people that have experiences like this fall into the error of thinking they are channeling some dead spirit.  One becomes a “shaman” and goes on pilgrimage to Palenque or Sedona. Through lack of an understanding of the deeper layers of mind, one thinks that one has become a medium.  Meditation is a technique to concentrate on the inner I-Witness behind all mental phenomenon.  Here is infinity and it is only in this inner bliss that the mind becomes free of all fetters.  Occult vision is definitely a fetter as seen from this point of view.  Instead of seeing the infinite One beyond the confines of the relative mind, one becomes enamored with interesting information that passes through the relative medium of mind.  Most egos can’t handle the information and end up going off on some kind of “spiritual” ego trip as they fall into the traps of name and fame at having achieved some “paranormal” ability. 
	
I have never looked for this knowledge. Whatever little understanding I think I have is only because my mind was quiet and free of intentionality when these experiences ocurred. My experiences with this information make more sense the less I think of this information as coming from a disembodied spirit.  Although I do feel a distinct presence, the experience comes across more as a “download” of information rather than some kind of dialogue with a deceased spirit, However, I don't totally reject the idea that something of that particular mind was present in these experiences.  Furthermore, the nature of this information was purely spiritual and was revealing certain universal laws of spirit instead of the idiosyncrasies of some departed being.  There was no language describing these forms, just pure ideas.  These ideas comport very well with the Indian Tantra that I am more familiar with. 
	
I tell of this experience as a practical example of microvita. Microvita science is a science that can only be properly understood when the entire mind has become an object for the immortal Atman, the I-Witness of mind. It is only when there is this clarity of self-understanding ensconsed in the Supreme Subjectivity of the Atman that it is possible for one to see a little of the inner dynamics of heaven. Microvita science is something much more subtle than spiritism in that there is essentially no recognition of any spirit apart from the eternal spirit of Atman. All spirits are but sparks of the Atman. Only the Atman can understand its own creation. Atman is the Supreme Consciousness and Supreme Subjectivity who sees all events in all places of the universe. 
	
The Tantra Maya practices of Quetzal Manik are definitely Tantric in origin, as they are, in some aspects, identical to those of eastern forms of Tantra.  If one reads the Tibetan Tantric Texts one sees that they are basically transposed forms of Indian Tantra that influenced Tibetan Tantra.  Although each has their uniqueness, it is so easy to see that words and concepts for Brahma, Shiva, or Shiva were simply called "Shunya," or "Void" in Tibetan Tantra.  Quetzal Manik was definitely a theist, however he had a certain Buddhist mystique of not getting too caught up in names for what is so transcendentally vast and beyond our little conceptual minds.  For him, as for all Tantrics, spiritual realization is based on sadhana, or spiritual practice. 
	
In Indian Tantra, the active, dynamic definition of Spirit or Atman is called Shiva- the “great god.” The Mayan Tantrics call It "Hunab Ku," the Cosmic Nuclueus, the nucleus of all nuclei in the universe.   Spirits, or microcosmic minds, are termed “deva,” or gods.  Devas are sparks born out of the Shiva. They all radiate around the Cosmic Nucleus of Hunab Ku.  A deva refers to any microcosmic mind, embodied or disembodied, from ant to angel. All beings evolve back into oneness with the Shiva or Hunab Ku.  Just as all microcosmic minds in this planet make up the Gia, or Earth Mother, all of the microcosmic minds in the universe make up the Macrocosmic Mind, the Tao current that underlies and inter-weaves our deep, inner lives in a “dance of the blessed spirits.” This work is an attempt to explain such subtle, natural experiences in light of the rigorous philosophy and intuitive spiritual practices of Tantra. 

Pluma Blanca, apart from being a tantric yogi, was an indigenous Mayan healer and astrologer. They were all one science for him, however. 

I learned some meditation techniques necessary to merely begin to understand astrology. He said it was an intuitive science that needed direct, mystical experience. This requires one to surrender one’s little microcosmic existence into the Macrocosm, the universe as a whole. This type of mystical experience was very different than what I had previously understood as mysticism. I suppose my ideas were more classical. I always liked the Upanishads, Toaism, and contemplatives like Meister Eckhart, Plotinus and Ramana Maharshi. They represented the peak spiritual knowledge in my opinion. Tantra Maya is a very elevated form of nature mysticism. Its purpose is to understand the pure subjectivity of the inner self, like in classical mysticism, yet at the same time develop a deep connection with the natural creation. One contemplates the with spirit within for self-realization while one connects to the subtle realms of nature to work with and serve the living, vibrant Macrocosm.

Pluma Blanca also taught this style of meditation, although with more of a tone of Zen formlessness regarding the mystery of the absolute. Astrology, however, required a different style of meditation. One doesn’t need to go upward but downward, toward the center of the earth. One can only meditate this way after having awakened the kundalini to rise upward and sustain it in a higher center. Meanwhile, the higher mind of the Macrocosm helps the yogi to understand the secrets of the earth below. The Anahata Chakra or Spiritual Heart is the perfect place for this work. It is in the center of the body as well as the center of the mind. It is a higher spiritual center, while at the same time it maintains contact with the grosser mental levels below. It may guide and pufify them and lead the lower instincts into purer expressions of spiritual awareness. It is the seat of the Intuitive Mind (Vijinamaya Kosa) and gives one deep knowledge of self, others, and the whole universe. The purer is one’s spiritual heart, the purer is one’s intuitive knowledge. One cannot be ambitious with this path. Only mature meditators whose lives are already deeply fused into the life of the Macrocosm of Brahma can perform these practices.

I write now not to describe these subtle practices, but rather to explain some interesting ideas that result from them. Pluma Blanca explained that the new baktun, or orbit of the sun around the Milky Way Galaxy, would begin at the end of 2015. This is the actual point in which the cycle begins anew. He didn’t speak of one specific date in which a great catastrophe would occur but rather explained that these were long cycles and the transitions into the new cycle were very gradual. He saw it as a process that lasts for decades. However, by the time we reach the end of 2015, the electromagnetic changes of the earth will be greatly accelerated. This translates into more severe weather patterns, natural disasters, and also intense mental confusion and imbalance. I will continue to try and understand these teachings and attempt to communicate them to the best of my ability. Twenty years ago I saw my whole past and future life on this planet pass before me. I saw my future homes, both in the U.S. and Mexico, as well as some great changes to the global map. Too many things have actually come to pass and so it is impossible for me to ignore this experience, and it makes me wonder if the rest of the future elements of the vision will also be revealed as truth. Each year that passes has only put newer pieces to this jigsaw puzzle that I saw briefly yet completely long ago. I prefer the risk of being in error as a false psychic rather than say nothing about this.

Pluma Blanca always had a very elevated vibration. When people came near him they would begin to sway in a counter-clockwise direction. Sometimes their heads would begin to tilt and subtly twirl in an almost imperceptible circular motion. He explained that whether you are speaking of the Cosmic Nucleus of Hunab Ku or the Conscious Nucleus of the Atman radiating behind our minds, the movement around either a physical or spiritual nucleus is always a play of the centripetal and centrifugal forces. They have the same dynamics on all planes of being. There are physical vortexes of motion in the physical world where there is the weight and gravity of matter and also vortexes of subtle, mental energy that act and interact with thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. To harmonize the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universe with the individual, one must find this secret flow of Tao both within the mind and in one’s world, planet, and its plants and animals.
On the outside Pluma Blanca’s ancestors studied the movement of the planets and the natural cycles. This practice was never disconnected to the internal practice of meditation. Meditation is the science of seeing behind all of the vortexes and movements of the human mind. A mind that is pure sees into and understands the movements around Hunab Ku, the Cosmic Nucleus that is within us all. Every human being that has truly searched has seen into this great treasure deep within a balanced human existence. We understand that there is always something pure, eternally renewed when we live in harmony with creation. This inspiration has never abandoned us, only we have forgotten It.

A Not So Fleeting Romance

Quetzal Manik came by the clinic for a surprise visit a few years ago. It was my first time to see him. He seemed to know all about me but didn’t say very much. He hardly even spoke Spanish. He liked to talk to me about Tantra and share ideas of the Tantra of the Mayas, the lineage of meditation and healing that he learned from his fore-fathers. Although a healer of all types of diseases, he was fundamentally a mystic who loved to meditate in the forest. He was my wife’s teacher, an indigenous Maya from Campeche. When my wife was attending a European patient he went to the clinic and entered the treatment room directly. He grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper and then wrote down a list of names on the paper. The names were the first and last names of the lovers the young woman had in the last year. The list was a little too long.

He would speak in Maya but nobody understood him. He then began to write to her in Spanish while somebody else translated to her in English. He explained that when humans have sexual intercourse their minds remain energetically connected for 7 years. There is a subtle transmission and continued connection of mental energy shared between the 2 entities. This may be something very pure and harmonious or it may be painful or even degrading, depending on the nature of the relationship. Even though they may never see, nor even think of each-other again, there remain subtle mental impressions that “reside” within each-other.

Another complicating factor is the mental confusion that one carries if one changes or has frequent partners. The imbalanced, frustrated, and distorted energies of others sympathetically vibrate with the minds of an individual person, and vice-versa. It sounded as if he was speaking of the transmission of a mental virus in much the same way as a physical virus, but with the mind and its clusters of memories and emotions as the vehicle of transmission directly into another mind. Instead of being infected physically, one remains “infected” by another’s mind for 7 years. A part of that person’s soul, or subtle mind is carried inside and continues to live inside of another, for better or for worse. The soul becomes an over-crowded house instead of a silent temple.
He explained quite compassionately that her emotional instability was only worsened by her romantic adventures and were gradually making her physically ill. She was an attractive young woman with very liberal values who simply didn’t understand these ideas before he explained it to her. She didn’t feel threatened nor judged, and seriously pondered his diagnosis. I believe that her conscience understood what Pluma Blanca was communicating. She knew she was suffering and wasn’t happy and somebody had just probed into her private life to offer her some clues as to how to understand her confusions. Before the treatment she was terrorizing all of the young spiritually-disciplined boys around here with her tiny, mini skirts. After that treatment she put on a more modest skirt.

Om in C

Although Pluma Blanca was born 114 years on this planet earlier than when I met him, he was a perfect child who always liked to share his toys with me. This little Indian always radiates joy, at least when he isn’t scolding people. On one of our first meetings he just looks at me and mentally says, “first go into silence, hear Om in breathlessness and then take note of its tone.” I could hear the Om sound vibrating within and it seemed to correspond something close to the tone of C. I got my flute out and played a C and it sounded like I was playing at the same tone as the sacred Om sound that was resounding around my pineal gland. Later he said, “Now hear it in C-sharp.” My head went back and I started to lose contact with the outside world and be absorbed into a great white silence that the Om at C-sharp was taking me into.

When I came back down he said, “now what is in your mind?” I closed my eyes and saw so many images and histories and stories flash before my mind. He continued: “You will verify all of this in the next few years. It will all come to pass.”

These events indeed are coming to pass, like entries in an apocalyptic diary. It was the saddest story ever conceived, although the story should soon change for the better. My friend could see the future and help his friends to do the same. Spiritual experiences like this don’t happen so regularly as it is too powerful of an experience for most to digest. The present is challenging enough without knowing the future. Ignorance is sometimes a blessing, but Pluma Blanca knew that it was necessary to understand these things.

Nahuatl

Pluma Blanca once told me that a Nahuatl is a healer that sees not just into the minds of animals but also into those of humans. Beyond even seeing into the souls of humans the true Nahuatl sees into the Oversoul, the conscious substatum that unites us all. He says that to enter a human mind is usually more difficult and dangerous than entering into a mind of an animal. Humans are less innocent and their mental contents may make such a rare and pure entity as a Nahuatl ill if he or she resonates too close with other human emotional turmoil. Animals see us as gods and naturally resonate with and reflect the mental states of their gods. The nahuatl prefers to see the mere reflection of a human’s problems by “hacking” the minds of the animals under their care. That way, the contact with the other human mind is not too direct and doesn’t affect the seer and also the minds of those seen into. Also,people often feel strangely transparent and often uncomfortable when they feel that another can see through them. Animals, like innocent children, may give very truthful and unbiased information and just tell it like it is. Although a dog can’t speak, they reflect most of this human resonance unconsciously and what lives and vibrates in the mind of the master is also there in the mind of the canine disciple. A nahuatl may learn many things about you through your dog, horse, or even donkey!

It has been said that very developed tantric yogis have the power of mind over matter in that whatever they put their focused, disciplined minds on will certainly materialize. Though quite rare, there have been numerous examples of yogis with these bizarre qualities through the ages.

One day Pluma Blanca (White Feather) came to visit bon Nadie at Rancho el Misterio. He spoke much of this phenomenon with practical examples. He said that developed shaman really can even have some degree of control over the weather. This amazed bon Nadie the most as Pluma Blanca was so calm and unsensational while speaking about these abilities. Rather, he took these truths very seriously. He always warned about these abilities, however. “What if you lose control of an emotion and end up manifesting your deepest shadow tendencies?,” he said. He was 110 years old and never spent much time in the cities but he really did understand modern people. The most amazing and diffult thing to believe is when he told bon Nadie that Nahuatls (those who enter the minds of animals) are real and that they can look into the Oversoul of humanity and into the Divine Eye that sees past, present, and future. They can see all minds, not just those of animals.  He said that it is nice to see a human mind from time to time, but he mostly just sees animal minds in human form.

On the way back south, bon Nadie took him to a store to buy some food for the trip. It was an elite part of town. Most people had skin the same color of bon Nadie’s. However, instead of the usual ignorance or normal sociability toward his person, he noticed that some people gave him nasty, scornful looks. They looked even worse at Pluma Blanca. Bon Nadie remained still, just looking back at them. He was in a light, dreamy trance  and saw so much bad history, impunity, suffering and hateful prejudice behind these people’s expressions. He was angry at their ideas and where they come from but still couldn’t judge these superficial people, except to say that they are superficial people.

One woman was particularly rude and pushed him to the edge of his patience. She thought that bon Nadie was one of her kind based on appearances. When he didn’t respond to her flirtations, she became downright spiteful and said under hear breath, “maldito indio” or “damned indian.” He wanted to respond and say:  “because my heart is the same as my friends, then I too am a damned indian.” However, Pluma Blanca came over laughing and pulled him out of the store. “Let your wife pay, we will wait out here,” he said. I knew that he knew I was a little annoyed. He sait quietly for several minutes and then responded: “They will get their lessons very soon.” Now Pluma Blanca was known as an oracle and I wasn’t sure if he was speaking about the future of the world and all of the racists and imperialists or if he was talking about this one woman in particular.

At that moment the racist woman came out of the store and Pluma Blanca began to giggle like a small child. It was as if he had done something naughty and was trying to hide it. A stray dog approached the woman, raised his leg, and soaked her stockings.

Black Crows

Pluma Blanca arrived at the ranch the other day. He came just at the right time as I was completely exhausted with the defense of our ranch against the Santa Muerte neighbors. They are the narco-trafficker's religious cult that is protected by the local government in many places.  Whenever these demons kidnap and torture people they turn on a motorcycle without a muffler that is very noisy and covers the screams of the tortured. I had hardly slept for a week because they turned on that motorcycle every night between midnight and 3 a.m., the traditional “witching hour” when dark occultists have traditionally performed their rights. Instead of sleeping, I meditated all through these dark hours.

The ranch was recently invaded by a flock of crows. They come and attack the other birds. We had almost no birds here in the desert until we dug our trenches to collect rainwater and make a mini oasis. To me, it seemed a perfect literary image: all of this suffering and death adorned with a final, dreadful touch of black crows that prey on our peaceful dove and sparrow. It was as if reality is communicating with me through symbols. Its uncanny, but is it just my imagination?

Pluma Blanca began beating his drum and shouting in Maya and then chanting “Baba Nam Kevalam.” I ran outside from my meditations and was inspired to go and attack the narco compound with my bare hands, such was the inspiration. He was chasing off the crows. I understood that he saw them as an ominous symbol. He pointed to the crows and then to the direction of the narco compound. I intuitively understood that he saw the crows as a live symbol connected with the narco camp. If we run them off, then we effect those whom they serve. It all made a certain symbolic sense, and I went along with it all in a high state of emotion and put my intellectual questions aside for the moment. At that time we begin to hear the motorcycle. It gets closer and we see a man riding it and shouting like a madman. It was the first time we had seen the motorcycle and the rider leave the compound. We had a chance to look him in the eyes and send him a gaze that penetrated his entire being. He won’t come around any longer.

I have lived with indigenous Mexicans for the last 13 years. Although I sometimes doubt their credulity in such magic realities, I have seen so many occasions in which these ideas have lead to the most amazing revelations of truth.

He understood all of these practices without superstition and myth and taught very advanced, systematic meditations to understand these “magical realities.”
