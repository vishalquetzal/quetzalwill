<strong>Books on Tantra Maya by Quetzal Eckhart </strong>


My books are published on this site in their entirety.  I also offer a .pdf format that you can download.  I use my essays, books and music to raise money for my wife's projects to help the indigenous communities of Mexico. One can see her work on <a href="facebook.com/clinica.misterio"> Facebook.</a>  If one would like to donate for the books, music, or our social service activities with the indigenous communities of Mexico, then one may make a deposit directly into my account in their preferred manner.  However, if you are really interested in having the .pdf version but are unable to donate, then just send me an email and I will give you the download link.  Those who donate should also send me an email and request the download link.
